<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
  SideBySearch ("we", "us", "our") provides a service that compares Bing and
  Google search results. We prioritize privacy and do not store personal data on
  our servers. All searches are processed in real time.
</p>
<h2>Information We Process</h2>
<p>
  <strong>Search Queries:</strong> Your queries are processed in real time
  solely to fetch search results. We do not log or retain your queries on our
  servers.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Local Data:</strong> Recent search terms are stored locally in your
  browser using local storage. This data remains on your device and is never
  transmitted to us.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Cookies &amp; Local Storage:</strong><br />
  • We store recent searches in your browser's <code>localStorage</code> under
  the key <code>recentSearches</code>; we do not set first-party analytics
  cookies.<br />
  • Two first-party cookies (<code>FCCDCF</code> and <code>FCNEC</code>) are set
  on .sidebysearch.org (path "/") for Cloudflare compliance: they hold encoded
  state and do not track you across sites.<br />
  • If ads load, third-party cookies from Google AdSense may appear (e.g.
  <code>IDE</code>, <code>test_cookie</code>, <code>ANID</code>, etc.).<br />

</p>
<h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
<p>
  <strong>Search APIs:</strong> We retrieve search results using
  <a
    href="https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-us/privacystatement"
    target="_blank"
    rel="noopener"
    >Bing Search APIs</a
  >
  and
  <a
    href="https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en-US"
    target="_blank"
    rel="noopener"
    >Google Custom Search APIs</a
  >. Data transmitted to these services is subject to their own privacy
  policies.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Advertising:</strong> Our site displays Google Ads to cover API costs.
  Any data collected through these ads is governed by
  <a
    href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads?hl=en-US"
    target="_blank"
    rel="noopener"
    >Google's privacy policy</a
  >.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Cloudflare Workers:</strong> We employ
  <a
    href="https://www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy/"
    target="_blank"
    rel="noopener"
    >Cloudflare Workers</a
  >
  to cache API responses for up to 300 seconds. This caching improves
  performance and does not store any personal data.
</p>
<h2>Data Security</h2>
<p>
  We enforce secure connections (HTTPS) and adhere to industry-standard security
  practices to protect data. No personally identifiable information is stored or
  processed on our servers.
</p>
<p>
  Additionally, our API endpoints implement rate limiting and access controls to
  allow only requests originating from our domain. These measures help protect
  our API resources from abuse.
</p>
<h2>Referrer Policy</h2>
<p>
  We send <code>Referrer-Policy: no-referrer</code> headers to prevent sharing
  your page's URL with any third party.
</p>
<h2>Your Rights and Controls</h2>
<p>
  <strong>Local Data:</strong> You may clear your recent search data by managing
  your browser's local storage.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Cookies:</strong> Your browser settings allow you to manage or delete
  cookies at any time.
