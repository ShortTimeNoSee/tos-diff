    >We have made some updates to our Privacy Policy. This version of the
    Privacy Policy will go into effect on July 28, 2025. Until then, the
    <a href="#current">current Privacy Policy</a> continues to apply.</b

<h2>Before you scroll, read this</h2>
<p>
  It’s really hard to make everyone happy with a Privacy Policy. Most people who
  use X want something short and easy to understand. While we wish we could fit
  everything you need to know into a post, our regulators ask us to meet our
  legal obligations by describing them all in a lot of detail.
</p>
<p>
  With that in mind, we’ve written our Privacy Policy as simply as possible to
  empower you to make informed decisions when you use X by making sure you
  understand and have control over the information we collect, how it’s used,
  and when it’s shared. 
</p>
<p>
  So if you skip reading every word of the Privacy Policy, at least know this:

<h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
<p>
  The information we collect when you use X falls into three categories.<br />
</p>
<p><b>1.1 Information you provide us.</b></p>
<p>
  To use some of our products and services you need to have an account, and to
  create an account, you need to provide us certain information. Likewise, if
  you use our paid products and services, we cannot provide them to you without
  getting payment information. Basically, certain information is necessary if
  you want to use many of our products and services.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      <b>Personal Accounts.</b> If you create an account, you must provide us
      with some information so that we can provide our services to you. This
      includes a display name (for example, “Creators”); a username (for
      example, @XCreators); a password; an email address or phone number; a date
      of birth; your display language; and third-party single sign-in
      information (if you choose this sign-in method). You can also choose to
      share your location in your profile and posts, and to upload your address
      book to X to help find people you may know. Your profile information,
      which includes your display name and username, is always public, but you
      can use either your real name or a pseudonym. And remember, you can create
      multiple X accounts, for example, to express different parts of your
      identity, professional or otherwise. 
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <b>Professional Accounts.</b> If you create a
      <a
        href="https://business.x.com/en/help/account-setup/professional-accounts.html"
        target="_blank"
        >professional account</a
      >, you also need to provide us with a professional category, and may
      provide us with other information, including street address, contact email
      address, and contact phone number, all of which will always be public. 
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <b>Payment Information.</b> In order to purchase ads or other offerings
      provided as part of our paid products and services you will need to
      provide us payment information, including your credit or debit card
      number, card expiration date, CVV code, and billing address.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <b>Preferences.</b> When you set your preferences using your <a
        href="https://x.com/settings"
        >settings</a
      >, we collect that information so that we can respect your preferences.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <b>Biometric Information.</b> Based on your consent, we may collect and
      use your biometric information for safety, security, and identification
      purposes.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <b>Job Applications / Recommendations.</b> We may collect and use your
      personal information (such as your biographical information, employment
      history, educational history, employment preferences, skills and
      abilities, and job search activity and engagement, in addition to the
      information we already collect as disclosed in the “Information we collect
      when you use X” section of our Privacy Policy below) to recommend
      potential jobs to you, to share with potential employers when you apply
      for a job, to enable connections for professional opportunities, and to
      show you more relevant advertising.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p><b>1.2 Information we collect when you use X.</b></p>
<p>
  When you use our services, we collect information about how you use our
  products and services. We use that information to provide you with products
  and services, to help keep X more secure and respectful for everyone, and more
  relevant to you.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Usage Information.</b> We collect information about your activity on X,
  including:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Posts and other content you post (including the date, application, and
    version of X) and information about your broadcast activity (e.g., Spaces),
    including broadcasts you’ve created and when you created them, your lists,
    bookmarks, and Communities you are a part of.
  </li>
  <li>
    Your interactions with other users’ content, such as reposts, likes,
    bookmarks, shares, downloads, replies, if other users mention or tag you in
    content or if you mention or tag them, and broadcasts you’ve participated in
    (including your viewing history, listening, commenting, speaking, and
    reacting).
  </li>
  <li>
    How you interact with others on the platform, such as people you follow and
    people who follow you, metadata related to <a
      href="https://help.x.com/using-x/encrypted-direct-messages"
      >Encrypted Messages</a
    >, and when you use <a href="https://help.x.com/using-x/direct-messages"
      >Direct Messages</a
    >, including the contents of the messages, the recipients, and date and time
    of messages.
  </li>
  <li>
    If you communicate with us, such as through email, we will collect
    information about the communication and its content.
  </li>
  <li>
    We collect information on links you interact with across our services
    (including in our emails sent to you).
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  <b>Purchase and payments.</b> To allow you to make a payment or send money
  using X features or services, including through an intermediary, we may
  receive information about your transaction such as when it was made, when a
  subscription is set to expire or auto-renew, and amounts paid or received.<br />
</p>
<p>
  <b>Device Information. </b>We collect information from and about the devices
  you use to access X, including:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Information about your connection, such as your IP address, browser type,
    and related information.
  </li>
  <li>
    Information about your device and its settings, such as device and
    advertising ID, operating system, carrier, language, memory, apps installed,
    and battery level.
  </li>
  <li>Your device address book, if you’ve chosen to share it with us.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  <b>Location Information.</b> When you use X, we collect some information about
  your approximate location to provide the service you expect, including showing
  you relevant ads. You can also choose to share your current precise location
  or places where you’ve previously used X by enabling these settings in your
  account.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Inferred Identity. </b>We may collect or receive information that we use to
  infer your identity as detailed below:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    When you sign into X on a browser or device, we will associate that browser
    or device with your account. Subject to your settings, we may also associate
    your account with browsers or devices other than those you use to sign into
    X (or associate your signed-out device or browser with other browsers or
    devices or X-generated identiﬁers).
  </li>
  <li>
    When you provide other information to X, including an email address or phone
    number, we associate that information with your X account. Subject to your
    settings, we may also use this information in order to infer other
    information about your identity, for example by associating your account
    with hashes of email addresses that share common components with the email
    address you have provided to X.
  </li>
  <li>
    When you access X and are not signed in, we may infer your identity based on
    the information we collect.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  <b>Log Information. </b>We may receive information when you view content on or
  otherwise interact with our products and services, even if you have not
  created an account or are signed out, such as:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    IP address and related information; browser type and language; operating
    system; the referring webpage; access times; pages visited; location; your
    mobile carrier; device information (including device and application IDs);
    search terms and IDs (including those not submitted as queries); ads shown
    to you on X; X-generated identiﬁers; and identiﬁers associated with cookies.
    We also receive log information when you click on, view, or interact with
    links on our services, including when you install another application
    through X.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  <b>Advertisements.</b> When you view or interact with ads we serve on or oﬀ X,
  we may collect information about those views or interactions (e.g., watching a
  video ad or preroll, clicking on an ad, interacting with reposts of or replies
  to an ad).
</p>
<p>
  <b>Cookies and similar technologies.</b> Like many websites, we use cookies
  and similar technologies to collect additional website usage data and to
  operate our services. Cookies are not required for many parts of our products
  and services such as searching and looking at public proﬁles. You can learn
  more about how we use cookies and similar technologies <a
    href="https://help.x.com/rules-and-policies/x-cookies"
    >here</a
  >.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Interactions with our content on third-party sites.</b> When you view our
  content on third-party websites that integrate X content, such as embedded
  timelines or post buttons, we may receive log information that includes the
  web page you visited.
</p>
<p><b>1.3 Information we receive from third parties.</b></p>
<p>
  When you use other online products and services, they may share information
  about that usage with us.<b>
    <br />
    <br />
    Ad Partners, Developers, Publishers.</b
  > Our ad and business partners share information with us such as browser
  cookie IDs, X-generated identifiers,<a
    href="https://twitter.com/en/privacy#overlay-chapter2.6.1"
    ><b> </b></a
  >mobile device IDs, hashed user information like email addresses, demographic
  or interest data, and content viewed or actions taken on a website or app.
  Some of our ad partners, particularly our advertisers, also enable us to
  collect similar information directly from their website or app by integrating
  our advertising technology. Information shared by ad partners and affiliates
  or collected by X from the websites and apps of ad partners and affiliates may
  be combined with the other information you share with X and that X receives,<b
  > </b>generates, or infers<b> </b>about you described elsewhere in this
  Privacy Policy.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Other Third Parties, Account Connections, and Integrations.</b> We may
  receive information about you from third parties who are not our ad partners,
  such as other X users, developers, and partners who help us evaluate the
  safety and quality of content on our platform, our
  <a
    href="https://help.x.com/rules-and-policies/x-services-and-corporate-affiliates"
    >corporate affiliates</a
  >, and other services you link to your X account. You may choose to connect
  your X account to your account on another service, and that other service may
  send us information about your account on that service.
</p>
<h2>2. How We Use Information</h2>
<p>
  Breaking down how we use the information we collect is not simple because of
  the way the systems that bring our services to you work. For example, the same
  piece of information may be used differently for different purposes to
  ultimately deliver a single service. We think it’s most useful to describe the
  five main ways we use information and if you have questions that are not
  answered, you can always
  <a href="https://help.x.com/forms/privacy">contact us</a>. Here we go:<br />
</p>
<p><b>2.1 Operate, improve, and personalize our services.</b></p>
<p>
  We use the information we collect to provide and operate X products and
  services. We also use the information we collect to improve and personalize
  our products and services so that you have a better experience on X, including
  by showing you more relevant content and ads, suggesting people and topics to
  follow, enabling and helping you discover
  <a
    href="https://help.x.com/rules-and-policies/x-services-and-corporate-affiliates"
    >affiliates</a
  >, third-party apps, and services. We may use the information we collect and
  publicly available information to help train our machine learning or
  artificial intelligence models for the purposes outlined in this policy.<br />
  <br />
  We may use the information we collect from accounts of other services that you
  choose to connect to your X account to provide you features like cross-posting
  or cross-service authentication, and to operate our services.
</p>
<p>
  We use your contact information to help others find your account if your
  settings permit, including through third-party services and client
  applications.
</p>
<p>
  We use your information to provide our advertising and sponsored content
  services subject to your
  <a href="https://x.com/settings/account">settings</a>, which helps make ads on
  X more relevant to you. We also use this information to measure the
  effectiveness of ads and to help recognize your devices to serve you ads on
  and off of X. Some of our ad partners also enable us to collect similar
  information directly from their website or app by integrating our advertising
  technology. Information shared by ad partners and affiliates or collected by X
  from the websites and apps of ad partners and affiliates may be combined with
  the other information you share with X and that X receives, generates, or
  infers about you, as described elsewhere in our Privacy Policy.
</p>
<p><b>2.2  Foster safety and security.</b></p>
<p>
  We use information we collect to provide for the safety and security of our
  users, our products, services, and your account. This includes verifying your
  identity, authenticating your account, and defending against fraud,
  unauthorized use, and illegal activity. We also use the information to
  evaluate and affect the safety and quality of content on X - this includes
  investigating and enforcing our policies and and terms, as well as applicable
  law.
</p>
<p><b>2.3 Measure, analyze and make our services better.</b></p>
<p>
  We use the information we collect to measure and analyze the effectiveness of
  our products and services and to better understand how you use them in order
  to make them better.
</p>
<p><b>2.4 Communicate with you about our services.</b></p>
<p>
  We use the information we collect to communicate with you about our products
  and services, including about product updates and changes to our policies and
  terms. If you’re open to hearing from us, we may also send you marketing
  messages from time to time.
</p>
<p><b>2.5 Research.</b></p>
<p>
  We use information you share with us, or that we collect to conduct research,
  surveys, product testing, and troubleshooting to help us operate and improve
  our products and services.
</p>
<h2>3. Sharing Information</h2>
<p>
  You should know the ways we share your information, why we share it, and how
  you can control it. There are five general ways we share your information.<br />
</p>
<p><b>3.1 When you post and share.</b></p>
<p>
  <b>With the general public</b>. You are directing us to disclose that
  information as broadly as possible. X content, including your profile
  information (e.g., name/pseudonym, username, profile pictures), is available
  for viewing by the general public. The public does not need to be signed in to
  view some content on X. They may also find X content off of X: for example,
  from search query results on Internet search engines or videos downloaded and
  reshared elsewhere (depending on your
  <a href="https://help.x.com/using-x/x-videos">settings</a>).<br />
  <br />
  <b>With other X users.</b> Depending on your
  <a href="https://x.com/settings/account" target="_blank">settings</a>, and
  based on the X products and services you use, we share:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Your interactions with X content of other users, such as replies, and people
    you follow.
  </li>
  <li>
    Content you send to a specific X user, such as through
    <a href="https://help.x.com/using-x/direct-messages">Direct Messages</a>.
    Please keep in mind that if you’ve shared information like Direct Messages
    or protected posts with someone else who accesses X through a third-party
    service, the information may be shared with the third-party service.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  <b>With partners.</b> Depending on your
  <a href="https://x.com/settings/account">settings</a>, we also provide certain
  third parties with information to help us offer or operate our products and
  services. You can learn more about these partnerships in our
  <a href="https://help.x.com/safety-and-security/data-through-partnerships"
    >Help Center</a
  >. You can control whether X shares your personal information with these
  partners by using the “Data sharing with business partners” option in your
  <a href="https://x.com/settings/privacy_and_safety"
    >Privacy &amp; Safety settings</a
  >. (This setting does not control sharing described elsewhere in this Privacy
  Policy, such as when we share information with our service providers, or
  through partnerships other than as described in this
  <a href="https://help.x.com/safety-and-security/data-through-partnerships"
    >Help Center</a
  >
  article.)
</p>
<p><b>3.2 With third parties &amp; third-party integrations.</b></p>
<p>
  <b>With service providers.</b> We may share your information with our
  <a href="https://privacy.x.com/subprocessors">service providers</a> that
  perform functions and provide services on our behalf, including payment
  services providers who facilitate payments; service providers that host our
  various blogs and wikis; service providers that help us understand the use of
  our services; applicant tracking system providers to send and receive
  applicant and job data to potential employers; and those that provide fraud
  detection services. 
</p>
<p>
  <b>With advertisers.</b> Advertising revenue enables us to provide our
  products and services. Advertisers may learn information from your engagement
  with their ads on or off X. For example, if you click on an external link or
  ad on our services, that advertiser or website operator might figure out that
  you came from X, along with other information associated with the ad you
  clicked, such as characteristics of the audience it was intended to reach and
  other X-generated identifiers for that ad. They may also collect other
  personal information from you, such as cookie identifiers, or your IP address.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Third-party content &amp; integrations.</b> We share or disclose your
  information with your consent or at your direction, such as when you
  <a
    href="https://help.x.com/managing-your-account/connect-or-revoke-access-to-third-party-apps?lang=browser"
    >authorize a third-party web client or application</a
  >
  to access your account or when you direct us to share your feedback with a
  business. Similarly, to improve your experience, we work with third-party
  partners to display their video content on X or to allow cross-platform
  sharing. When you watch or otherwise interact with content from our video or
  cross-platform sharing partners, they may receive and process your personal
  information as described in their privacy policies. For video content, you can
  adjust your<a href="https://x.com/settings/autoplay"> autoplay settings</a> if
  you prefer that content not to play automatically.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Third-party collaborators.</b> Depending on your
  <a href="https://x.com/settings/account">settings</a>, or if you decide to
  share your data, we may share or disclose your information with third parties.
  If you do not opt out, in some instances the recipients of the information may
  use it for their own independent purposes in addition to those stated in X’s
  Privacy Policy, including, for example, to train their artificial intelligence
  models, whether generative or otherwise. 
</p>
<p>
  <b>Through our APIs.</b> We use technology like<a
    href="https://help.x.com/rules-and-policies/x-api"
  >
    APIs</a
  >
  and embeds to make public X information available to websites, apps, and
  others for their use, for example, displaying posts on a news website or
  analyzing what people say on X. We generally make this content available in
  limited quantities for free and charge licensing fees for large-scale access.
  We have
  <a href="https://developer.x.com/developer-terms">standard terms</a> that
  govern how this information can be used, and a compliance program to enforce
  these terms. But these individuals and companies are not affiliated with X,
  and their offerings may not reflect updates you make on X. For more
  information about how we make public data on X available to the world, visit
  <a href="https://developer.x.com/">https://developer.x.com</a>.
</p>
<p>
  <b>3.3 When required by law, to prevent harm, or in the public interest.</b>
</p>
<p>
  We may preserve, use, share, or disclose your information if we believe that
  it is reasonably necessary to:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    comply with a law, regulation,
    <a href="https://help.x.com/rules-and-policies/x-law-enforcement-support"
      >legal process, or governmental request</a
    >;
  </li>
  <li>
    protect the safety of any person, protect the safety or integrity of our
    platform, including to help prevent spam, abuse, or malicious actors on our
    services;
  </li>
  <li>
    explain why we have removed content or accounts from our services (e.g., for
    a violation of <a href="https://help.x.com/rules-and-policies/x-rules"
      >our Rules</a
    >);
  </li>
  <li>address fraud, security, or technical issues; or</li>
  <li>
    protect our rights or property, or the rights or property of those who use
    our services.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  We may also use different signals and your data to infer, preserve, use,
  share, or disclose your age and identity information in order to comply with
  regulatory requirements as well as for safety, security, fraud,
  know-your-customer, know-your-business, and identity verification, as the case
  may be. We may also share or disclose your age and identity information with
  our partners, service providers, and others for these purposes.
</p>
<p><b>3.4 With our Affiliates.</b></p>
<p>
  We may share information amongst our
  <a
    href="https://help.x.com/rules-and-policies/x-services-and-corporate-affiliates"
    >affiliates</a
  >
  to provide our products and services.
</p>
<p><b>3.5 As a result of a change in ownership.</b></p>
<p>
  We may share, sell, or transfer information about you in connection with a
  merger, acquisition, reorganization, sale of assets, or bankruptcy. This
  Privacy Policy will apply to your personal information that is shared with
  (before and after the close of any transaction) or transferred to the new
  entity.
</p>
<h2>4. How Long We Keep Information</h2>
<p>
  We keep different types of information for different periods of time,
  depending on how long we need to retain it in order to provide you with our
  products and services, to comply with our legal requirements and for safety
  and security reasons. For example:<br />
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    We keep your profile information, such as your display name, user name,
    password and email address for the duration of your account. We cannot
    provide you with our products and services without retaining this
    information.
  </li>
  <li>
    We keep your usage information, such as the content you post, your
    interactions with other users’ content and how you interact with others on
    the platform for the duration of your account or until such content is
    removed.
  </li>
  <li>
    We keep your payment information, including your credit or debit card number
    and billing address for the duration you use our paid products and services.
    Records of transactions will be kept for longer, in accordance with
    applicable law.
  </li>
  <li>
    If you communicate with us, such as through email, we will keep information
    about the communication and its content for up to 18 months, unless it is
    necessary for us to retain it for a longer period to comply with our legal
    obligations or to exercise or defend our legal rights.
  </li>
  <li>
    We generally collect device information, location information, inferred
    identity information and log information using cookies. We keep cookies and
    information collected using cookies for up to 13 months. You can learn more
    about how we use cookies and similar technologies
    <a href="https://help.x.com/rules-and-policies/x-cookies">here</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    We keep information about your views or interactions with ads on or off X,
    as well as how you interact with our content on third-party sites for up to
    12 months. 
  </li>
  <li>
    We keep information shared by ad and business partners for up to 12 months.
  </li>
  <li>
    Where you violate our Rules and your account is suspended, we may keep the
    identifiers you used to create the account (such as your email address or
    phone number) indefinitely to prevent repeat policy offenders from creating
    new accounts.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  We may need to keep certain information longer than our policies specify in
  order to comply with legal requirements and for safety and security reasons.
  For example:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <b
      >To comply with a law, regulation, legal process or governmental
      request.</b
    >
    Including in order to adhere to a legally appropriate preservation request
    made by law enforcement. You can read more about law enforcement access
    <a href="https://help.x.com/rules-and-policies/x-law-enforcement-support#6"
      >here</a
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>In connection with legal claims, litigation and regulatory matters.</b>
    Including where it is reasonably necessary to retain information relating to
    your account in order to defend X against legal claims.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>To maintain the safety and security of our products and services.</b>
    Including where it is necessary to store your information longer in order to
    investigate and fight abuse on our products and services.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Remember public content can exist elsewhere even after it is removed from X.
  For example, search engines and other third parties may retain copies of your
  posts longer, based upon their own privacy policies, even after they are
  deleted or expire on X. You can read more about search visibility
  <a
    href="https://help.x.com/safety-and-security/remove-x-profile-from-google-search"
    >here</a
  >.
</p>
<h2>5. Take Control</h2>
<p><b>5.1 Access, Correction, Portability.</b></p>
<p>
  You can access, correct, or modify the information you provided to us by
  editing your profile and adjusting your account
  <a href="https://x.com/settings/account" target="_blank">settings</a>.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      You can learn more about the information we have collected or inferred
      about you in<a href="https://twitter.com/settings/your_twitter_data"> </a
      ><a href="https://x.com/settings/your_twitter_data">Your X Data</a> and
      request access to additional information<a
        href="https://help.twitter.com/forms/privacy"
      >
      </a
      ><a href="https://help.x.com/forms/privacy">here</a>.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      You can download a copy of your information, such as your posts, by
      following the instructions
      <a
        href="https://help.x.com/managing-your-account/how-to-download-your-x-archive"
        >here</a
      >.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  To protect your privacy and maintain security, we take steps to verify your
  identity before granting you access to your personal information or complying
  with a deletion, portability, or other related request. We may, in certain
  situations, reject your request for access, correction, or portability, for
  example, we may reject access where you are unable to verify your identity.<br />
</p>
<p><b>5.2 Deleting your Information.</b></p>
<p>
  If you follow the instructions
  <a href="https://help.x.com/managing-your-account/how-to-deactivate-x-account"
    >here</a
  >, your account will be deactivated and your data will be queued for deletion.
  When deactivated, your X account, including your display name, username, and
  public profile, will no longer be viewable on X.com, X for iOS, and X for
  Android. For up to 30 days after deactivation it is still possible to restore
  your X account if it was accidentally or wrongfully deactivated.
</p>
<p><b>5.3 Objecting to, Restricting, or Withdrawing your Consent.</b></p>
<p>
  You can manage your privacy settings and other account features<a
    href="https://twitter.com/settings/account"
  >
  </a
  ><a href="https://x.com/settings/account">here</a>. If you change your
  settings it may take some time for your choices to be fully reflected
  throughout our systems. You may also notice changes in your X experience or
  limitations in your ability to access certain features depending on the
  settings you’ve adjusted. You may also manage additional settings when
  interacting with certain content and features on different parts of the
  platform, such as whether a
  <a href="https://help.x.com/using-x/spaces" target="_blank">Space</a> is
  recorded, or whether
  <a href="https://help.x.com/using-x/x-videos" target="_blank"
    >videos you upload</a
  >
  are downloadable by others.<br />
</p>
<p><b>5.4 Authorized Agent Requests.</b></p>
<p>
  To submit a request related to access, modification, or deletion of your
  information, or someone else’s information if you are their authorized agent,
  you may also contact us as specified in the How To Contact X section of our
  Privacy Policy below. We may require you to provide additional information for
  verification.
</p>
<h2>6. Your Rights and Ours</h2>
<p>
  We provide X to people all over the world and provide many of the same privacy
  tools and controls to all of our users regardless of where they live. However,
  your experience may be slightly different than users in other countries to
  ensure X respects local requirements.<br />
</p>
<p><b>6.1 We have specific legal bases to use your information.</b></p>
<p>
  X has carefully considered the legal reasons it is permitted to collect, use,
  share and otherwise process your information. If you want to dig in to learn
  more and better understand the nuances, we’d encourage you to check out
  <a
    href="https://help.x.com/rules-and-policies/data-processing-legal-bases"
    target="_blank"
    >this additional information about data processing</a
  >. And no, we don’t sell your personal information. 
</p>
<p><b>6.2 We move your data to make X work for you.</b></p>
<p>
  Just as you use X to seamlessly participate in global conversations with
  people in countries all over the world, X must move information across borders
  and to different countries around the world to support the safe and reliable
  service you depend on. For example, if you live in Europe and are having a
  conversation with someone in the United States, information has to move
  between those countries to provide that experience – it’s what you expect from
  us.
</p>
<p>
  We also use data centers and cloud providers, and engage
  <a
    href="https://help.x.com/rules-and-policies/x-services-and-corporate-affiliates"
    >our affiliates</a
  >
  and third-party partners and
  <a href="https://privacy.x.com/subprocessors">service providers</a> located in
  many parts of the world to help us provide our services. Before we move data
  between countries we look at the risks that may be presented to the data and
  rely on
  <a
    href="https://commission.europa.eu/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/standard-contractual-clauses-scc_en"
    >standard contractual clauses</a
  >
  (SCCs), where applicable, to ensure your data rights are protected. To request
  a copy of the SCCs, please contact us
  <a href="https://help.x.com/forms/privacy">here</a>. If data will be shared
  with a third party, we require them to maintain the same protections over your
  data that we provide directly.
</p>
<p>
  X is a <a href="https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/list">participant</a> in
  the EU-US Data Privacy Framework (DPF), the Swiss-US DPF and the UK Extension
  to the EU-US DPF. X complies with the DPF Principles for all its processing of
  personal data received from the European Union, Switzerland and the UK, in
  reliance on the EU-US DPF, Swiss-US DPF and UK Extension to the EU-US DPF,
  respectively. If you have an inquiry or complaint related to our participation
  in the DPF, please contact us
  <a href="https://help.x.com/forms/privacy">here</a>. As part of our
  participation in the DPF, if you have a dispute with us about our adherence to
  the DPF Principles, we will seek to resolve it through our internal complaint
  resolution process, alternatively through the US-based independent dispute
  resolution body
  <a href="https://www.jamsadr.com/DPF-Dispute-Resolution">JAMS</a>, and under
  certain conditions, through the DPF Arbitration Process following the
  procedures and subject to the conditions described in
  <a
    href="https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/framework-article/ANNEX-I-introduction"
    >Annex 1</a
  > to the DPF Principles. DPF participants are subject to the investigatory and
  enforcement powers of the US Federal Trade Commission and other authorized
  statutory bodies. Under certain circumstances, participants may be liable for
  the transfer of personal data from the EU, Switzerland and the UK to third
  parties outside the EU, Switzerland and the UK. Learn more about the EU-US

<h2>Before you scroll, read this</h2>
<p>
  It’s really hard to make everyone happy with a Privacy Policy. Most people who
  use X want something short and easy to understand. While we wish we could fit
  everything you need to know into a post, our regulators ask us to meet our
  legal obligations by describing them all in a lot of detail.
</p>
<p>
  With that in mind, we’ve written our Privacy Policy as simply as possible to
  empower you to make informed decisions when you use X by making sure you
  understand and have control over the information we collect, how it’s used,
  and when it’s shared. 
</p>
<p>
  So if you skip reading every word of the Privacy Policy, at least know this:

<h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
<p>
  The information we collect when you use X falls into three categories.<br />
</p>
<p><b>1.1 Information you provide us.</b></p>
<p>
  To use some of our products and services you need to have an account, and to
  create an account, you need to provide us certain information. Likewise, if
  you use our paid products and services, we cannot provide them to you without
  getting payment information. Basically, certain information is necessary if
  you want to use many of our products and services.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      <b>Personal Accounts.</b> If you create an account, you must provide us
      with some information so that we can provide our services to you. This
      includes a display name (for example, “Creators”); a username (for
      example, @XCreators); a password; an email address or phone number; a date
      of birth; your display language; and third-party single sign-in
      information (if you choose this sign-in method). You can also choose to
      share your location in your profile and posts, and to upload your address
      book to X to help find people you may know. Your profile information,
      which includes your display name and username, is always public, but you
      can use either your real name or a pseudonym. And remember, you can create
      multiple X accounts, for example, to express different parts of your
      identity, professional or otherwise. 
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <b>Professional Accounts.</b> If you create a
      <a
        href="https://business.x.com/en/help/account-setup/professional-accounts.html"
        target="_blank"
        >professional account</a
      >, you also need to provide us with a professional category, and may
      provide us with other information, including street address, contact email
      address, and contact phone number, all of which will always be public. 
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <b>Payment Information.</b> In order to purchase ads or other offerings
      provided as part of our paid products and services you will need to
      provide us payment information, including your credit or debit card
      number, card expiration date, CVV code, and billing address.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <b>Preferences.</b> When you set your preferences using your <a
        href="https://x.com/settings"
        >settings</a
      >, we collect that information so that we can respect your preferences.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <b>Biometric Information.</b> Based on your consent, we may collect and
      use your biometric information for safety, security, and identification
      purposes.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <b>Job Applications / Recommendations.</b> We may collect and use your
      personal information (such as your biographical information, employment
      history, educational history, employment preferences, skills and
      abilities, and job search activity and engagement, in addition to the
      information we already collect as disclosed in the “Information we collect
      when you use X” section of our Privacy Policy below) to recommend
      potential jobs to you, to share with potential employers when you apply
      for a job, to enable connections for professional opportunities, and to
      show you more relevant advertising.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p><b>1.2 Information we collect when you use X.</b></p>
<p>
  When you use our services, we collect information about how you use our
  products and services. We use that information to provide you with products
  and services, to help keep X more secure and respectful for everyone, and more
  relevant to you.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Usage Information.</b> We collect information about your activity on X,
  including:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Posts and other content you post (including the date, application, and
    version of X) and information about your broadcast activity (e.g., Spaces),
    including broadcasts you’ve created and when you created them, your lists,
    bookmarks, and Communities you are a part of.
  </li>
  <li>

  you relevant ads. You can also choose to share your current precise location
  or places where you’ve previously used X by enabling these settings in your

</p>
<p>
  <b>Inferred Identity. </b>We may collect or receive information that we use to
  infer your identity as detailed below:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    When you sign into X on a browser or device, we will associate that browser
    or device with your account. Subject to your settings, we may also associate
    your account with browsers or devices other than those you use to sign into
    X (or associate your signed-out device or browser with other browsers or
    devices or X-generated identiﬁers).
  </li>
  <li>
    When you provide other information to X, including an email address or phone
    number, we associate that information with your X account. Subject to your
    settings, we may also use this information in order to infer other
    information about your identity, for example by associating your account
    with hashes of email addresses that share common components with the email
    address you have provided to X.
  </li>
  <li>
    When you access X and are not signed in, we may infer your identity based on

</ul>
<p>
  <b>Advertisements.</b> When you view or interact with ads we serve on or oﬀ X,

  video ad or preroll, clicking on an ad, interacting with reposts of or replies
  to an ad).
</p>
<p>
  <b>Cookies and similar technologies.</b> Like many websites, we use cookies
  and similar technologies to collect additional website usage data and to

  web page you visited.
</p>
<p><b>1.3 Information we receive from third parties.</b></p>
<p>
  When you use other online products and services, they may share information
  about that usage with us.<b>
    <br />
    <br />
    Ad Partners, Developers, Publishers.</b
  > Our ad and business partners share information with us such as browser
  cookie IDs, X-generated identifiers,<a
    href="https://twitter.com/en/privacy#overlay-chapter2.6.1"
    ><b> </b></a
  >mobile device IDs, hashed user information like email addresses, demographic
  or interest data, and content viewed or actions taken on a website or app.
  Some of our ad partners, particularly our advertisers, also enable us to
  collect similar information directly from their website or app by integrating
  our advertising technology. Information shared by ad partners and affiliates
  or collected by X from the websites and apps of ad partners and affiliates may
  be combined with the other information you share with X and that X receives,<b
  > </b>generates, or infers<b> </b>about you described elsewhere in this
  Privacy Policy.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Other Third Parties, Account Connections, and Integrations.</b> We may
  receive information about you from third parties who are not our ad partners,
  such as other X users, developers, and partners who help us evaluate the
  safety and quality of content on our platform, our
  <a
    href="https://help.x.com/rules-and-policies/x-services-and-corporate-affiliates"
    >corporate affiliates</a
  >, and other services you link to your X account. You may choose to connect
  your X account to your account on another service, and that other service may
  send us information about your account on that service.
</p>
<h2>2. How We Use Information</h2>
<p>
  Breaking down how we use the information we collect is not simple because of
  the way the systems that bring our services to you work. For example, the same
  piece of information may be used differently for different purposes to
  ultimately deliver a single service. We think it’s most useful to describe the
  five main ways we use information and if you have questions that are not
  answered, you can always
  <a href="https://help.x.com/forms/privacy">contact us</a>. Here we go:<br />
</p>
<p><b>2.1 Operate, improve, and personalize our services.</b></p>
<p>
  We use the information we collect to provide and operate X products and
  services. We also use the information we collect to improve and personalize
  our products and services so that you have a better experience on X, including
  by showing you more relevant content and ads, suggesting people and topics to
  follow, enabling and helping you discover
  <a
    href="https://help.x.com/rules-and-policies/x-services-and-corporate-affiliates"
    >affiliates</a
  >, third-party apps, and services. We may use the information we collect and
  publicly available information to help train our machine learning or
  artificial intelligence models for the purposes outlined in this policy.<br />
  <br />
  We may use the information we collect from accounts of other services that you
  choose to connect to your X account to provide you features like cross-posting
  or cross-service authentication, and to operate our services.
</p>
<p>
  We use your contact information to help others find your account if your
  settings permit, including through third-party services and client
  applications.
</p>
<p>
  We use your information to provide our advertising and sponsored content
  services subject to your
  <a href="https://x.com/settings/account">settings</a>, which helps make ads on
  X more relevant to you. We also use this information to measure the
  effectiveness of ads and to help recognize your devices to serve you ads on
  and off of X. Some of our ad partners also enable us to collect similar
  information directly from their website or app by integrating our advertising
  technology. Information shared by ad partners and affiliates or collected by X
  from the websites and apps of ad partners and affiliates may be combined with
  the other information you share with X and that X receives, generates, or
  infers about you, as described elsewhere in our Privacy Policy.
</p>
<p><b>2.2  Foster safety and security.</b></p>
<p>
  We use information we collect to provide for the safety and security of our
  users, our products, services, and your account. This includes verifying your
  identity, authenticating your account, and defending against fraud,
  unauthorized use, and illegal activity. We also use the information to
  evaluate and affect the safety and quality of content on X - this includes
  investigating and enforcing our policies and and terms, as well as applicable
  law.
</p>
<p><b>2.3 Measure, analyze and make our services better.</b></p>
<p>
  We use the information we collect to measure and analyze the effectiveness of
  our products and services and to better understand how you use them in order
  to make them better.
</p>
<p><b>2.4 Communicate with you about our services.</b></p>
<p>
  We use the information we collect to communicate with you about our products
  and services, including about product updates and changes to our policies and
  terms. If you’re open to hearing from us, we may also send you marketing
  messages from time to time.
</p>
<p><b>2.5 Research.</b></p>
<p>
  We use information you share with us, or that we collect to conduct research,
  surveys, product testing, and troubleshooting to help us operate and improve
  our products and services.
</p>
<h2>3. Sharing Information</h2>
<p>
  You should know the ways we share your information, why we share it, and how
  you can control it. There are five general ways we share your information.<br />
</p>
<p><b>3.1 When you post and share.</b></p>
<p>
  <b>With the general public</b>. You are directing us to disclose that
  information as broadly as possible. X content, including your profile
  information (e.g., name/pseudonym, username, profile pictures), is available
  for viewing by the general public. The public does not need to be signed in to
  view some content on X. They may also find X content off of X: for example,
  from search query results on Internet search engines or videos downloaded and
  reshared elsewhere (depending on your
  <a href="https://help.x.com/using-x/x-videos">settings</a>).<br />
  <br />
  <b>With other X users.</b> Depending on your
  <a href="https://x.com/settings/account" target="_blank">settings</a>, and
  based on the X products and services you use, we share:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Your interactions with X content of other users, such as replies, and people
    you follow.
  </li>
  <li>
    Content you send to a specific X user, such as through
    <a href="https://help.x.com/using-x/direct-messages">Direct Messages</a>.
    Please keep in mind that if you’ve shared information like Direct Messages
    or protected posts with someone else who accesses X through a third-party
    service, the information may be shared with the third-party service.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  <b>With partners.</b> Depending on your
  <a href="https://x.com/settings/account">settings</a>, we also provide certain
  third parties with information to help us offer or operate our products and
  services. You can learn more about these partnerships in our
  <a href="https://help.x.com/safety-and-security/data-through-partnerships"
    >Help Center</a
  >. You can control whether X shares your personal information with these
  partners by using the “Data sharing with business partners” option in your
  <a href="https://x.com/settings/privacy_and_safety"
    >Privacy &amp; Safety settings</a
  >. (This setting does not control sharing described elsewhere in this Privacy
  Policy, such as when we share information with our service providers, or
  through partnerships other than as described in this
  <a href="https://help.x.com/safety-and-security/data-through-partnerships"
    >Help Center</a
  >
  article.)
</p>
<p><b>3.2 With third parties &amp; third-party integrations.</b></p>
<p>
  <b>With service providers.</b> We may share your information with our
  <a href="https://privacy.x.com/subprocessors">service providers</a> that
  perform functions and provide services on our behalf, including payment
  services providers who facilitate payments; service providers that host our
  various blogs and wikis; service providers that help us understand the use of
  our services; applicant tracking system providers to send and receive
  applicant and job data to potential employers; and those that provide fraud
  detection services. 
</p>
<p>
  <b>With advertisers.</b> Advertising revenue enables us to provide our
  products and services. Advertisers may learn information from your engagement
  with their ads on or off X. For example, if you click on an external link or
  ad on our services, that advertiser or website operator might figure out that
  you came from X, along with other information associated with the ad you
  clicked, such as characteristics of the audience it was intended to reach and
  other X-generated identifiers for that ad. They may also collect other
  personal information from you, such as cookie identifiers, or your IP address.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Third-party content &amp; integrations.</b> We share or disclose your
  information with your consent or at your direction, such as when you
  <a
    href="https://help.x.com/managing-your-account/connect-or-revoke-access-to-third-party-apps?lang=browser"
    >authorize a third-party web client or application</a
  >
  to access your account or when you direct us to share your feedback with a
  business. Similarly, to improve your experience, we work with third-party
  partners to display their video content on X or to allow cross-platform
  sharing. When you watch or otherwise interact with content from our video or
  cross-platform sharing partners, they may receive and process your personal
  information as described in their privacy policies. For video content, you can
  adjust your<a href="https://x.com/settings/autoplay"> autoplay settings</a> if
  you prefer that content not to play automatically.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Third-party collaborators.</b> Depending on your
  <a href="https://x.com/settings/account">settings</a>, or if you decide to
  share your data, we may share or disclose your information with third parties.
  If you do not opt out, in some instances the recipients of the information may
  use it for their own independent purposes in addition to those stated in X’s
  Privacy Policy, including, for example, to train their artificial intelligence
  models, whether generative or otherwise. 
</p>
<p>
  <b>Through our APIs.</b> We use technology like<a
    href="https://help.x.com/rules-and-policies/x-api"
  >
    APIs</a
  >
  and embeds to make public X information available to websites, apps, and
  others for their use, for example, displaying posts on a news website or
  analyzing what people say on X. We generally make this content available in
  limited quantities for free and charge licensing fees for large-scale access.
  We have
  <a href="https://developer.x.com/developer-terms">standard terms</a> that
  govern how this information can be used, and a compliance program to enforce
  these terms. But these individuals and companies are not affiliated with X,
  and their offerings may not reflect updates you make on X. For more
  information about how we make public data on X available to the world, visit
  <a href="https://developer.x.com/">https://developer.x.com</a>.
</p>
<p>
  <b>3.3 When required by law, to prevent harm, or in the public interest.</b>
</p>
<p>
  We may preserve, use, share, or disclose your information if we believe that
  it is reasonably necessary to:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    comply with a law, regulation,
    <a href="https://help.x.com/rules-and-policies/x-law-enforcement-support"
      >legal process, or governmental request</a
    >;
  </li>
  <li>
    protect the safety of any person, protect the safety or integrity of our
    platform, including to help prevent spam, abuse, or malicious actors on our
    services;
  </li>
  <li>
    explain why we have removed content or accounts from our services (e.g., for
    a violation of <a href="https://help.x.com/rules-and-policies/x-rules"
      >our Rules</a
    >);
  </li>
  <li>address fraud, security, or technical issues; or</li>
  <li>
    protect our rights or property, or the rights or property of those who use
    our services.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  We may also use different signals and your data to infer, preserve, use,
  share, or disclose your age and identity information in order to comply with
  regulatory requirements as well as for safety, security, fraud,
  know-your-customer, know-your-business, and identity verification, as the case
  may be. We may also share or disclose your age and identity information with
  our partners, service providers, and others for these purposes.
</p>
<p><b>3.4 With our Affiliates.</b></p>
<p>
  We may share information amongst our
  <a
    href="https://help.x.com/rules-and-policies/x-services-and-corporate-affiliates"
    >affiliates</a
  >
  to provide our products and services.
</p>
<p><b>3.5 As a result of a change in ownership.</b></p>
<p>
  We may share, sell, or transfer information about you in connection with a
  merger, acquisition, reorganization, sale of assets, or bankruptcy. This
  Privacy Policy will apply to your personal information that is shared with
  (before and after the close of any transaction) or transferred to the new
  entity.
</p>
<h2>4. How Long We Keep Information</h2>
<p>
  We keep different types of information for different periods of time,
  depending on how long we need to retain it in order to provide you with our
  products and services, to comply with our legal requirements and for safety
  and security reasons. For example:<br />
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    We keep your profile information, such as your display name, user name,
    password and email address for the duration of your account. We cannot
    provide you with our products and services without retaining this
    information.
  </li>
  <li>
    We keep your usage information, such as the content you post, your
    interactions with other users’ content and how you interact with others on
    the platform for the duration of your account or until such content is
    removed.
  </li>
  <li>
    We keep your payment information, including your credit or debit card number
    and billing address for the duration you use our paid products and services.
    Records of transactions will be kept for longer, in accordance with
    applicable law.
  </li>
  <li>
    If you communicate with us, such as through email, we will keep information
    about the communication and its content for up to 18 months, unless it is
    necessary for us to retain it for a longer period to comply with our legal
    obligations or to exercise or defend our legal rights.
  </li>
  <li>
    We generally collect device information, location information, inferred
    identity information and log information using cookies. We keep cookies and
    information collected using cookies for up to 13 months. You can learn more
    about how we use cookies and similar technologies
    <a href="https://help.x.com/rules-and-policies/x-cookies">here</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    We keep information about your views or interactions with ads on or off X,
    as well as how you interact with our content on third-party sites for up to
    90 days. 
  </li>
  <li>
    We keep information shared by ad and business partners for up to 90 days.
  </li>
  <li>
    Where you violate our Rules and your account is suspended, we may keep the
    identifiers you used to create the account (such as your email address or
    phone number) indefinitely to prevent repeat policy offenders from creating
    new accounts.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  We may need to keep certain information longer than our policies specify in
  order to comply with legal requirements and for safety and security reasons.
  For example:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <b
      >To comply with a law, regulation, legal process or governmental
      request.</b
    >
    Including in order to adhere to a legally appropriate preservation request
    made by law enforcement. You can read more about law enforcement access
    <a href="https://help.x.com/rules-and-policies/x-law-enforcement-support#6"
      >here</a
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>In connection with legal claims, litigation and regulatory matters.</b>
    Including where it is reasonably necessary to retain information relating to
    your account in order to defend X against legal claims.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>To maintain the safety and security of our products and services.</b>
    Including where it is necessary to store your information longer in order to
    investigate and fight abuse on our products and services.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Remember public content can exist elsewhere even after it is removed from X.
  For example, search engines and other third parties may retain copies of your
  posts longer, based upon their own privacy policies, even after they are
  deleted or expire on X. You can read more about search visibility
  <a
    href="https://help.x.com/safety-and-security/remove-x-profile-from-google-search"
    >here</a
  >.
</p>
<h2>5. Take Control</h2>
<p><b>5.1 Access, Correction, Portability.</b></p>
<p>
  You can access, correct, or modify the information you provided to us by
  editing your profile and adjusting your account
  <a href="https://x.com/settings/account" target="_blank">settings</a>.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      You can learn more about the information we have collected or inferred
      about you in<a href="https://twitter.com/settings/your_twitter_data"> </a
      ><a href="https://x.com/settings/your_twitter_data">Your X Data</a> and
      request access to additional information<a

      >
      </a
      ><a href="https://help.x.com/forms/privacy">here</a>.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      You can download a copy of your information, such as your posts, by
      following the instructions
      <a
        href="https://help.x.com/managing-your-account/how-to-download-your-x-archive"
        >here</a
      >.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  To protect your privacy and maintain security, we take steps to verify your
  identity before granting you access to your personal information or complying
  with a deletion, portability, or other related request. We may, in certain
  situations, reject your request for access, correction, or portability, for
  example, we may reject access where you are unable to verify your identity.<br />
</p>
<p><b>5.2 Deleting your Information.</b></p>
<p>
  If you follow the instructions
  <a href="https://help.x.com/managing-your-account/how-to-deactivate-x-account"
    >here</a
  >, your account will be deactivated and your data will be queued for deletion.
  When deactivated, your X account, including your display name, username, and
  public profile, will no longer be viewable on X.com, X for iOS, and X for
  Android. For up to 30 days after deactivation it is still possible to restore
  your X account if it was accidentally or wrongfully deactivated.
</p>
<p><b>5.3 Objecting to, Restricting, or Withdrawing your Consent.</b></p>
<p>
  You can manage your privacy settings and other account features<a
    href="https://twitter.com/settings/account"
  >
  </a
  ><a href="https://x.com/settings/account">here</a>. If you change your
  settings it may take some time for your choices to be fully reflected
  throughout our systems. You may also notice changes in your X experience or
  limitations in your ability to access certain features depending on the
  settings you’ve adjusted. You may also manage additional settings when
  interacting with certain content and features on different parts of the
  platform, such as whether a
  <a href="https://help.x.com/using-x/spaces" target="_blank">Space</a> is
  recorded, or whether
  <a href="https://help.x.com/using-x/x-videos" target="_blank"
    >videos you upload</a
  >
  are downloadable by others.<br />
</p>
<p><b>5.4 Authorized Agent Requests.</b></p>
<p>
  To submit a request related to access, modification, or deletion of your
  information, or someone else’s information if you are their authorized agent,
  you may also contact us as specified in the How To Contact X section of our
  Privacy Policy below. We may require you to provide additional information for
  verification.
</p>
<h2>6. Your Rights and Ours</h2>
<p>
  We provide X to people all over the world and provide many of the same privacy
  tools and controls to all of our users regardless of where they live. However,
  your experience may be slightly different than users in other countries to
  ensure X respects local requirements.<br />
</p>
<p><b>6.1 We have specific legal bases to use your information.</b></p>
<p>
  X has carefully considered the legal reasons it is permitted to collect, use,
  share and otherwise process your information. If you want to dig in to learn
  more and better understand the nuances, we’d encourage you to check out
  <a
    href="https://help.x.com/rules-and-policies/data-processing-legal-bases"
    target="_blank"
    >this additional information about data processing</a
  >. And no, we don’t sell your personal information. 
</p>
<p><b>6.2 We move your data to make X work for you.</b></p>
<p>
  Just as you use X to seamlessly participate in global conversations with
  people in countries all over the world, X must move information across borders
  and to different countries around the world to support the safe and reliable
  service you depend on. For example, if you live in Europe and are having a
  conversation with someone in the United States, information has to move
  between those countries to provide that experience – it’s what you expect from
  us.
</p>
<p>
  We also use data centers and cloud providers, and engage
  <a
    href="https://help.x.com/rules-and-policies/x-services-and-corporate-affiliates"
    >our affiliates</a
  >
  and third-party partners and
  <a href="https://privacy.x.com/subprocessors">service providers</a> located in
  many parts of the world to help us provide our services. Before we move data
  between countries we look at the risks that may be presented to the data and
  rely on
