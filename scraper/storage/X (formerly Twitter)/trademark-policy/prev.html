<h1>Trademark policy</h1>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<h3><b>April 2023</b></h3>
<p>
  <b
    ><br />
    You may not violate others’ intellectual property rights, including
    copyright and trademark.</b
  >
</p>
<p>
  A trademark is a word, logo, phrase, or device that distinguishes a trademark
  holder’s good or service in the marketplace. Trademark law may prevent others
  from using a trademark in an unauthorized or confusing manner.  <br />
  <br />
</p>
<h3>
  What is in violation of this policy?<br />
   
</h3>
<p>
  Using another’s trademark in a way that may mislead or confuse people about
  your affiliation may be a violation of our trademark policy.<br />
   
</p>
<h3>
  What is not a violation of this policy?<br />
   
</h3>
<p>
  Referencing another’s trademark is not automatically a violation of X's
  trademark policy. Examples of non-violations include:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    using a trademark in a way that is outside the scope of the trademark
    registration e.g., in a different territory, or a different class of goods
    or services than that identified in the registration; and
  </li>
  <li>
    using a trademark in a nominative or other fair use manner. For more

<h3>
  Who can report violations of this policy?<br />
   
</h3>
<p>
  X only investigates requests that are submitted by the trademark holder or
  their authorized representative e.g., a legal representative or other
  representative for a brand. <br />
   
</p>
<h3>
  How can I report violations of this policy?<br />
   
</h3>

  incomplete report, we’ll need to follow up about the missing information.

<h3>
  What happens if you violate this policy?<br />
  <br />
</h3>
<p>
  If we determine that you violated our trademark policy, we may suspend your
  account. Depending on the type of violation, we may give you an opportunity to
  comply with our policies. In other instances, an account may be permanently
  suspended upon first review. If you believe that your account was suspended in
  error, you can
