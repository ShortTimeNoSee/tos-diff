<h1>Non-consensual nudity policy</h1>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>
  <b
    ><br />
    December 2021</b
  >
</p>
<p>
  <b
    >You may not post or share intimate photos or videos of someone that were
    produced or distributed without their consent.</b
  >
</p>
<p>
  Sharing explicit sexual images or videos of someone online without their
  consent is a severe violation of their privacy and the
  <a
    href="/en/rules-and-policies/twitter-rules.html"
    target="_self"
    rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"
    >X Rules</a
  >. Sometimes referred to as revenge porn, this content poses serious safety
  and security risks for people affected and can lead to physical, emotional,
  and financial hardship.<br />
  <br />
</p>
<h3>What is a violation of this policy?</h3>
<p>
  <br />
  Under this policy, you can’t post or share explicit images or videos that were
  taken, appear to have been taken or that were shared without the consent of
  the people involved.
</p>
<p>
  Examples of the types of content that violate this policy include, but are not
  limited to:<br />
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    hidden camera content featuring nudity, partial nudity, and/or sexual acts;
  </li>
  <li>
    creepshots or upskirts - images or videos taken of people’s buttocks, up an
    individual’s skirt/dress or other clothes that allows people to see the
    person’s genitals, buttocks, or breasts; 
  </li>
  <li>
    images or videos that superimpose or otherwise digitally manipulate an
    individual’s face onto another person’s nude body; 
  </li>
  <li>
    images or videos that are taken in an intimate setting and not intended for
    public distribution; and
  </li>
  <li>
    offering a bounty or financial reward in exchange for intimate images or
    videos.<br />
     
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>What is not a violation of this policy?</h3>
<p>
  <br />
  Pornography and other forms of consensually produced adult content are allowed
  on X, provided that this media is marked as sensitive. Doing so provides
  people who may not want to see this type of content with a warning that they
  will need to acknowledge before viewing your media. 
</p>
<p>
  To mark your media as sensitive, navigate to your
  <a
    href="https://twitter.com/settings/safety"
    target="_blank"
    rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"
    >safety settings</a
  >
  and select the
  <b>Mark media you post as containing material that may be sensitive</b>
  option. If you don’t mark your media as sensitive, we may do so manually if
  your content is reported for review. <br />
  <br />
</p>
<h3>Who can report violations of this policy?</h3>
<p>
  <br />
  Because X allows some types of adult content, we need to evaluate context to
  assess if reported content has been created or shared without the consent of
  those involved. <br />
   
</p>
<p><b>Content reportable by anyone</b></p>
<p>
  We recognize that it can be difficult for those impacted to report this type
  of content for review. To reduce the burden on those affected, anyone can
  report the following types of content:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>creepshots or upskirts;</li>
  <li>
    content where a bounty or financial reward is offered in exchange for
    non-consensual nudity media; and
  </li>
  <li>intimate images or videos that are accompanied by:</li>
  <li>
    text that wishes/hopes for harm to come to those depicted or otherwise
    refers to revenge e.g., “I hope you get what you deserve when people see
    this”; and
  </li>
  <li>
    information that could be used to contact those depicted e.g., “You can tell
    my ex what you think by calling them on 1234567”.<br />
     
  </li>
</ul>
<p><b>Content reportable by featured individual(s)</b></p>
<p>
  For other types of content, we may need to hear directly from the
  individual(s) featured (or an authorized representative, such as a lawyer) to
  ensure that we have sufficient context before taking any enforcement
  action. <br />
   
</p>

<p>
  You can also report this content via
  <a
    href="/en/forms/safety-and-sensitive-content/private-information.html"
    target="_blank"
    rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"
    >our private information report form</a
  >, by selecting the <b>An unauthorized photo or video</b> option.<br />
   
</p>
<h3>What happens if you violate this policy?</h3>
<p>
  <br />
  We will
  <b
    >immediately and permanently suspend any account that we identify as the
    original poster of intimate media</b
  >
  that was created or shared without consent. We will do the same with any
  account that posts only this type of content, e.g., accounts dedicated to
  sharing upskirt images.
</p>
<p>
  In other cases, we may not suspend an account immediately. This is because
  some people share this content inadvertently, to express shock, disbelief or
  to denounce this practice. In these cases, we will require you to remove this
  content. We will also temporarily lock you out of your account before you can
  post again. If you violate this policy again after your first warning, your
  account will be permanently suspended. If you believe that your account was
  suspended in error, you can
  <a

    target="_blank"
    rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"
    >submit an appeal</a
