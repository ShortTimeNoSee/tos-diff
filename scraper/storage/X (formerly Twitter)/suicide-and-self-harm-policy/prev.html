<h1>Suicide and Self-harm policy</h1>
<h3></h3>
<p>
  Overview<br />
   
</p>
<p><b>You may not promote or encourage suicide or self-harm.</b></p>
<p>
  At X, we recognize that suicide and self-harm are significant social &amp;
  public health challenges that require collaboration between all stakeholders –
  public, private, and civil society – and that we have a role and
  responsibility to help people access and receive support when they need it.<br />
</p>
<p>
  When developing this policy, we consulted extensively with experts to ensure
  that people who have engaged in self-harm or experienced suicidal thoughts can
  share their personal experiences. We also recognized the need to protect
  people from the potential harm caused by exposure to content that could
  promote or encourage self-harm – intentionally or inadvertently. That’s why
  our policy prohibits content that promotes or encourages self-harming
  behaviors and provides support to those undergoing experiences with self-harm
  or suicidal thoughts.<br />
   
</p>
<h3>
  What is in violation of this policy?<br />
   
</h3>
<p>
  Under this policy, you can’t promote, or otherwise encourage, suicide or
  self-harm. We define promotion and encouragement to include statements such as
  “the most effective”, “the easiest”, “the best”, “the most successful”, “you
  should”, “why don’t you”. Violations of this policy can occur via Posts,
  images or videos, including live video. 
</p>
<p>
  We define suicide to be the act of taking one’s own life. We define self-harm
  to include:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><p>self-inflicted physical injuries e.g., cutting; and</p></li>
  <li>
    <p>
      eating disorders e.g., bulimia, anorexia.<br />
       
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Violations of this policy include, but are not limited to:<br /></p>
<ul>
  <li><p>encouraging someone to physically harm or kill themselves;</p></li>
  <li>
    <p>
      asking others for encouragement to engage in self-harm or suicide,
      including seeking partners for group suicides or suicide games; and
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    sharing information, strategies, methods or instructions that would assist
    people to engage in self-harm and suicide.<br />
     
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>
  What is not a violation of this policy?<br />
   
</h3>
<p>
  Some examples of behavior that are not considered a violation of this policy
  include: 
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      sharing personal stories and experiences related to self-harm or suicide;
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      sharing coping mechanisms and resources for addressing self-harm or
      suicidal thoughts; and
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      discussions that are focused on research, advocacy, and education related
      to self-harm or suicide prevention.<br />
       
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  <b>Note</b>: people can share their personal experiences, but should avoid
  sharing detailed information about specific strategies or methods related to
  self-harm, as this could inadvertently encourage this behavior.<br />
   
</p>
<h3>
  Who can report violations of this policy?<br />
   
</h3>
<p>
  Anyone can report content that may encourage or promote suicide or self-harm
  via our in-app reporting or our
  <a href="https://help.twitter.com/forms/suicide" rel="nofollow"
    >specialized reporting form</a
  >. These reports are routed to a dedicated team who evaluate each case
  individually. 
</p>
<p>
  Note: if we receive a report that someone has expressed an intention to engage
  in self-harm or suicide, we will contact them directly, encourage them to seek
  support, and provide information about dedicated online and hotline resources.
  We may also work with law enforcement officials where appropriate, for
  example, if we receive a valid emergency disclosure request as defined in our
  <a

<h3>

  separate options for people who may be expressing an intention to harm
  themselves, and content that is encouraging or promoting self-harm or
  suicide.<br />

<h3>
  What happens if you violate this policy?<br />
   
</h3>
<p>
  Our enforcement approach depends on the type of content being shared, whether
  or not the reported account is encouraging or promoting self-harm or suicide,
  and the account’s previous history of violations. 
</p>
<p>
  If you violate this policy by sharing content that intentionally encourages
  others to harm themselves, ask others to encourage you to harm yourself, or
  share detailed information or instructions related to self-harm or suicide
  methods, we will require you to remove this content. We will also temporarily
  lock you out of your account before you can Post again. If you continue to
  violate this policy, or if your account is dedicated to promoting or
  encouraging self-harm or suicide, your account will be permanently suspended.
  If cases include images or videos related to self-harm or suicide, we will
  also evaluate this content under
  <a
    href="https://help.twitter.com/rules-and-policies/media-policy"
    rel="nofollow"
    >our sensitive media policy</a
  >. If you believe that your account was suspended in error,
  <a
    href="https://help.twitter.com/forms/general?subtopic=suspended"
    rel="nofollow"
    >you can submit an appeal</a
  >.<br />
</p>
<p>
  We may also take steps to prevent the spread of instructional material hosted
  on third-party websites by
  <a
    href="https://help.twitter.com/en/safety-and-security/phishing-spam-and-malware-links"
    rel="nofollow"
    >marking such links as unsafe</a
  >. <br />
