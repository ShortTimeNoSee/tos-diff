<h1>Hateful Conduct</h1>
<h3>
  Overview<br />
   
</h3>
<p><b>April 2023</b></p>
<p>
  You may not directly attack other people on the basis of race, ethnicity,
  national origin, caste, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, religious
  affiliation, age, disability, or serious disease. 
</p>
<p>
  X's mission is to give everyone the power to create and share ideas and
  information, and to express their opinions and beliefs without barriers. Free
  expression is a human right – we believe that everyone has a voice, and the
  right to use it. Our role is to serve the public conversation, which requires
  representation of a diverse range of perspectives. 
</p>
<p>
  We recognize that if people experience abuse on X, it can jeopardize their
  ability to express themselves. Research has shown that some groups of people
  are disproportionately targeted with abuse online. For those who identify with
  multiple underrepresented groups, abuse may be more common, more severe in
  nature, and more harmful.
</p>
<p>
  We are committed to combating abuse motivated by hatred, prejudice or
  intolerance, particularly abuse that seeks to silence the voices of those who
  have been historically marginalized. For this reason, we prohibit behavior
  that targets individuals or groups with abuse based on their perceived
  membership in a protected category.  
</p>
<p>
  If you see something on X that you believe violates this policy, please
  <a
    href="/en/forms/safety-and-sensitive-content/abuse.html"
    target="_blank"
    rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"
    >report it to us</a
  >.
</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What is in violation of this policy?<br /></h3>
<p>
  We will review and take action against reports of accounts targeting an
  individual or group of people with any of the following behavior, whether
  within Posts or Direct Messages. 
</p>
<p>
  <b
    >Hateful references<br />
    <br /> </b
  >We prohibit targeting individuals or groups with content that references
  forms of violence or violent events where a protected category was the primary
  target or victims, where the intent is to harass. This includes, but is not
  limited to media or text that refers to or depicts:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>genocides, (e.g., the Holocaust);</li>
  <li>lynchings.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  <b>Incitement<br /> </b>
</p>
<p>
  We prohibit inciting behavior that targets individuals or groups of people
  belonging to protected categories. This includes:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    inciting fear or spreading fearful stereotypes about a protected category,
    including asserting that members of a protected category are more likely to
    take part in dangerous or illegal activities, e.g., “all [religious group]
    are terrorists.”
  </li>
  <li>
    inciting others to harass members of a protected category on or off
    platform, e.g., “I’m sick of these [religious group] thinking they are
    better than us, if any of you see someone wearing a [religious symbol of the
    religious group], grab it off them and post pics!“
  </li>
  <li>
    inciting others to discriminate in the form of denial of support to the
    economic enterprise of an individual or group because of their perceived
    membership in a protected category, e.g., “If you go to a [religious group]
    store, you are supporting those [slur], let’s stop giving our money to these
    [religious slur].” This may not include content intended as political in
    nature, such as political commentary or content relating to boycotts or
    protests.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Note: content intended to incite violence against a protected category is
  prohibited under
  <a href="/en/rules-and-policies/violent-speech.html" rel="nofollow"
    >Violent Speech</a
  >.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Slurs and Tropes</b><br />
  <br />
  We prohibit targeting others with repeated slurs, tropes or other content that
  intends to degrade or reinforce negative or harmful stereotypes about a
  protected category. In some cases, such as (but not limited to) severe,
  repetitive usage of slurs, or racist/sexist tropes where the context is to
  harass or intimidate others, we may require Post removal. In other cases, such
  as (but not limited to) moderate, isolated usage where the context is to
  harass or intimidate others, we may limit Post visibility as further described
  below.
</p>
<p><b>Dehumanization</b></p>
<p>
  We prohibit the dehumanization of a group of people based on their religion,
  caste, age, disability, serious disease, national origin, race, ethnicity,
  gender, gender identity, or sexual orientation.
</p>
<p><b>Hateful Imagery </b></p>
<p>
  We consider hateful imagery to be logos, symbols, or images whose purpose is
  to promote hostility and malice against others based on their race, religion,
  disability, sexual orientation, gender identity or ethnicity/national origin.
  Some examples of hateful imagery include, but are not limited to:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    symbols historically associated with hate groups, e.g., the Nazi swastika;
  </li>
  <li>
    images depicting others as less than human, or altered to include hateful
    symbols, e.g., altering images of individuals to include animalistic
    features; or
  </li>
  <li>
    images altered to include hateful symbols or references to a mass murder
    that targeted a protected category, e.g., manipulating images of individuals
    to include yellow Star of David badges, in reference to the Holocaust.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Media depicting hateful imagery is not permitted within live video, account
  bio, profile or header images. All other instances must be marked as sensitive
  media. Additionally, sending an individual unsolicited hateful imagery is a
  violation of this policy. 
</p>
<p><b>Hateful Profile</b></p>
<p>
  You may not use hateful images or symbols in your profile image or profile
  header. You also may not use your username, display name, or profile bio to
  engage in abusive behavior, such as targeted harassment or expressing hate
  towards a person, group, or protected category.
</p>
<h3>
  Do I need to be the target of this content for it to be a violation of the X
  Rules?<br />
</h3>
<p>
  Some Posts may appear to be hateful when viewed in isolation, but may not be
  when viewed in the context of a larger conversation. For example, members of a
  protected category may refer to each other using terms that are typically
  considered as slurs. When used consensually, the context behind these terms is
  not abusive, but a means to reclaim terms that were historically used to
  demean individuals.  
</p>
<p>
  When we review this type of content, it may not be clear whether the context
  is to abuse an individual on the basis of their protected status, or if it is
  part of a consensual conversation. To help our teams understand the context,
  we sometimes need to hear directly from the person being targeted to ensure
  that we have the information needed prior to taking any enforcement action.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Note:</b> individuals do not need to be a member of a specific protected
  category for us to take action. We will never ask people to prove or disprove
  membership in any protected category and we will not investigate this
  information. 
</p>
<h3>What happens if you violate this policy?<br /></h3>
<p>
  Under this policy, we take action against behavior that targets individuals or
  an entire protected category with hateful conduct, as described above.
  Targeting can happen in a number of ways, for example, mentions, including a
  photo of an individual, referring to someone by their full name, etc.
</p>
<p>
  When determining the penalty for violating this policy, we consider a number
  of factors including, but not limited to the severity of the violation and an
  individual’s previous record of rule violations. The following is a list of
  potential enforcement options for content that violates this policy:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Making content less visible on X by:
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Removing the Post from search results, in-product recommendations,
          trends, notifications, and home timelines 
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Restricting the Post discoverability to the author’s profile</p>
      </li>
      <li><p>Downranking the Post in replies</p></li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Restricting Likes, replies, Reposts, Quote, bookmarks, share, pin to
          profile, or engagement counts 
        </p>
      </li>
      <li><p>Excluding the Post from having ads adjacent to it</p></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Excluding Posts and/or accounts in email or in-product recommendations. 
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    Requiring Post removal.
    <ul>
      <li>
        For example, we may ask someone to remove the violating content and
        serve a period of time in read-only mode before they can Post again.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Suspending accounts that violate our Hateful Profile policy.</li>
</ul>
