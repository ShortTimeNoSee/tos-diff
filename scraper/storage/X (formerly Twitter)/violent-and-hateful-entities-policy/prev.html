<h1>Violent and hateful entities policy</h1>
<h3>Overview</h3>

    April 2023</b

</p>
<p>
  There is no place on X for violent and hateful entities, including (but not
  limited to) terrorist organizations, violent extremist groups,
  <a
    href="https://help.twitter.com/rules-and-policies/perpetrators-of-violent-attacks"
    rel="nofollow"
    >perpetrators of violent attacks</a
  >, or individuals who affiliate with and promote their illicit activities. The
  violence and hate these entities engage in and/or promote jeopardizes the
  physical safety of those targeted.
</p>
<p>
  <b
    >You may not threaten terrorism and/or violent extremism, nor promote
    violent and hateful entities.</b

</p>
<p>
  Violent entities are those that deliberately target humans or essential
  infrastructure with physical violence and/or violent rhetoric as a means to
  further their cause. These include, but are not limited to, terrorist
  organizations, violent extremist groups, and

  promoted, supported and/or advocated for
  <a
    href="https://help.twitter.com/rules-and-policies/hateful-conduct-policy"

  towards a protected category.
