<h1>Civic integrity policy</h1>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<h3><b>August 2023</b></h3>
<p>
  <b
    >You may not use X’s services for the purpose of manipulating or interfering
    in elections or other civic processes, such as posting or sharing content
    that may suppress participation, mislead people about when, where, or how to
    participate in a civic process, or lead to offline violence during an
    election. </b
  >Any attempt to undermine the integrity of civic participation undermines our
  core tenets of freedom of expression and as a result, we will apply labels to
  violative posts informing users that the content is misleading.
</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>What is a civic process? </b></p>
<p>
  X considers civic processes to be events or procedures mandated, organized,
  and conducted by the governing and/or electoral body of a country, state,
  region, district, or municipality to address a matter of common concern
  through public participation. Some examples of civic processes may include: 
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Political elections</li>
  <li>Censuses </li>
  <li>
    Major referenda and ballot initiatives <br />
     
  </li>
</ul>
<p><b>What is in violation of this policy?</b></p>
<p>This policy addresses 4 categories of misleading behavior and content: </p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Misleading information about how to participate</b></p>
<p>
  You may not advance verifiably false or misleading information about how to
  participate in an election or other civic process. This includes but is not
  limited to:
</p>
<ul>

    (for example, that you can vote by Post, text message, email, or phone call
    in jurisdictions where these are not a possibility);
  </li>
  <li>
    misleading information about requirements for participation, including
    identification or citizenship requirements;
  </li>
  <li>
    misleading claims that cause confusion about the established laws,
    regulations, procedures, and methods of a civic process, or about the
    actions of officials or entities executing those civic processes; and
  </li>
  <li>
    misleading statements or information about the official, announced date or
    time of a civic process.
  </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Suppression</b></p>
