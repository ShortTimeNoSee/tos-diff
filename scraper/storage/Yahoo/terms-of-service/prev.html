          responsible for any content that you upload, post, email, transmit, or
          otherwise make available via the Services. We may remove and refuse to
          display content that violates the Terms or applicable laws or
          regulations, but that does not mean that we monitor the Services or
          review or screen any content. By using or accessing the Services you

          <em>Use of AI and Third-Party AI Providers</em>. Some of our Services
          have features and functionality powered by our trusted third-party AI
          providers (“AI Providers”). AI-powered chat service provided by
          Microsoft Copilot relies on search services from Bing. By utilizing
          our Services, you consent to sharing data that you provide to us, or
          that resides within your Yahoo account, including your Yahoo Mail
          inbox with our AI Providers for the purpose of enhancing features
          within our Services made available to you. In some instances, use of
          AI query features may be governed by the AI Provider’s terms of
          service and privacy policy. You understand and agree that content or
          responses generated by AI may contain inaccuracies and should never be
          relied upon without independent verification. Yahoo does not control
          the content or responses provided by AI Providers, and makes no
          representations or warranties about the accuracy or completeness of
          such content or responses (or the sites and sources accessed through
          such content or responses). You also agree not to enter sensitive
          personal information into any AI powered query.

          license to (a) use, host, store, reproduce, modify, prepare derivative
          works (such as translations, adaptations, summaries or other changes),
          communicate, publish, publicly perform, publicly display, and
          distribute this content in any manner, mode of delivery or media now
          known or developed in the future; and (b) permit other users to
          access, reproduce, distribute, publicly display, prepare derivative
          works of, and publicly perform your content via the Services, as may
          be permitted by the functionality of those Services (e.g., for users
          to re-blog, re-post or download your content). In some of the
          Services, there may be specific terms or settings allowing a different
          scope of use of the content submitted in those Services. You must have
          the necessary rights to grant us the license described in this Section
          6(c) for any content that you upload, share with or submit to the

      <a></a><strong>Fee-Based Services and Billing. </strong>Unless otherwise
      specified in the additional terms that apply to the Services you are
      using, the terms in this Section 11 apply to you.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          We offer products and subscriptions for a fee (“fee-based Services”).
          These fee-based Services are governed by the additional terms you
          agree to when you register for the fee-based Service and these Terms.
          If you register for a fee-based Service, you must designate a payment
          method and provide us with accurate billing and payment information
          and you have the continuing obligation to keep it up to date. Many
          fee-based Services require you to have, or register for, a Yahoo
          or AOL ID. If you are an AOL Dial-Up customer, please see additional
          terms by clicking <a
            href="/us/en/yahoo/terms/otos/additional/dial/index.html"
            >here</a
          >.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The following important provisions apply to all of our fee-based
          Services:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              Third-Party products. If the fee-based Service includes a
              third-party product, you understand and agree that your purchase
              and use of that service is also subject to the third party’s terms
              of service and privacy policy, which you should read thoroughly
              before agreeing to them.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Payments. You represent that you are at least the minimum age
              required to enter into a legal agreement. You agree to pay us for
              any fee-based Services you purchase from us, as well as all other
              charges incurred under your account, including applicable taxes
              and fees. You are responsible for all charges incurred under your
              account, including purchases made by you or anyone you allow to
              use your account or any sub-or linked accounts (including any
              person with implied, actual, or apparent authority) or anyone who
              gains access to your account as a result of your failure to
              safeguard your authentication credentials.

          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Payment Methods. You authorize and direct us to charge your
              designated payment method for these charges or, if it fails, to
              charge any other payment method you have on file with us, even if
              we received it in association with other fee-based services. You
              are responsible for all charges even if your payment method fails
              or is denied. You authorize and direct us to retain all
              information about any payment method(s) associated with your
              account. We may import payment information you entered during a
              prior purchase and provide you the option to use that payment
              information during purchase of a new product. You permit us to
              obtain and use updated information from the issuer of your payment
              method in accordance with the policies and procedures of any
              applicable card brands. We may in some instances continue charging
              a payment method past its expiration date at our discretion and
              subject to the payment processors' or issuing bank's approval.
              Surcharges may apply if you use certain payment methods, such as
              payment from your checking or savings account.

          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Payment Terms. We may charge for fee-based Services in advance and
              on a daily, monthly, yearly, lump sum, or other basis in
              accordance with the stated terms, as long as your subscription
              remains active, even if you have not downloaded or used the
              Service or accessed your online account.

          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Auto-Renewal. We use auto-renewal for many of our fee-based
              Services. At the expiration of each subscription term for such
              fee-based Services, we will automatically renew your subscription
              and charge the credit card or other payment method you have
              provided to us, unless you cancel your subscription at least 48
              hours before the end of the current period. Unless otherwise
              stated in Section 14, your subscription will be automatically
              renewed at the then-current price, excluding promotional and
              discount pricing. We may, in our sole discretion, post charges to
              your payment method individually or aggregate charges for some or
              all of your fee-based Services with us.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Fraud Protection. We may take steps to verify the validity of the
              credit card information you provide to us, including debiting
              amounts less than $1.00 from your credit card and then immediately
              crediting it back. You authorize us to do so for verification and
              anti-fraud purposes.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Free Trials. We may offer you free trials, so that you may try a
              fee-based Service subscription without charge or obligation ("Free
              Trial"). Unless otherwise stated and unless you cancel your
              subscription prior to the expiration of the Free Trial, periodic
              subscription fees will be charged at the then-applicable rate upon
              expiration of the Free Trial period and will continue to be
              charged until the subscription is canceled. If you are not
              satisfied with a particular fee-based Service, you must cancel the
              subscription before the Free Trial ends to avoid charges. We
              reserve the right to limit you to one Free Trial or promotion of a
              fee-based Service and to prohibit the combining of Free Trials or
              other promotional offers.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              No Refunds. All charges are nonrefundable unless provided
              otherwise in the terms you agree to when you register for a
              fee-based Service, unless stated differently for your country in
              Section 14 or as otherwise specified below.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Termination. We, in our sole discretion, may change, discontinue
              or terminate any or all aspects of a fee-based Service without
              notice, including access to support services, content and other
              products or services ancillary to the fee-based Service, subject
              to providing an appropriate refund for any portions of a specified
              but no longer available term. You may cancel a fee-based Service
              at any time by logging into your online account and terminating
              the subscription.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Change in Fees and Billing Method. We may change our fees and
              billing methods at any time. We will provide you with notice of
              any price increase at least thirty (30) days in advance. Subject
              to applicable law, (i) if you disagree with any proposed change,
              your sole remedy is to cancel your fee-based Service before the
              price change takes effect and (ii) your continued use of or
              subscription to the Service after the price change takes effect
              constitutes your agreement to pay the new price for the Service.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Delinquency. After 30 days from the date of any unpaid charges,
              your fee-based Service will be deemed delinquent and we may
              terminate or suspend your account and fee-based Service for
              nonpayment. You are liable for any fees, including attorney and
              collection fees, incurred by us in our efforts to collect any
              remaining balances from you.
            </p>

          <li>
            <p>
              90-Day Notice Period. You must notify us about any billing
              problems or discrepancies within 90 days after they first appear
              on your billing method statement. If you do not bring them to our
              attention within 90 days, you agree that you waive your right to
              dispute such problems or discrepancies.

                  <strong>Informal Dispute Resolution.</strong> If either you or
                  we intend to arbitrate a Dispute under these Terms, the party
                  seeking arbitration must first notify the other party of the
                  Dispute in writing at least 60 days in advance of initiating
                  the arbitration. Notice to us should be sent either by mail to
                  Yahoo, Attn: Disputes, 770 Broadway, New York, NY 10003, USA;
                  or
                  <a href="mailto:disputes@yahooinc.com"
                    >disputes@yahooinc.com</a
                  >. Notice to you will be to your email address(es) or street
                  address(es), if any, that we have in our records at the time
                  the notice is sent. The written description must be on an
                  individual basis and provide, at minimum, the following
                  information: the sender’s name; a description of the nature or
                  basis of the claim or Dispute; the specific relief sought;
                  and, if you are a Yahoo registered user, your Yahoo ID or
                  Yahoo email address. After receipt of the written description
                  by Yahoo, you and Yahoo agree to personally meet and confer,
                  via telephone or videoconference, to attempt to resolve the
                  Dispute. If a party is represented by counsel, that party’s
                  counsel may participate in the conference, but the party
                  themselves shall also personally attend the conference.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If we are unable to resolve the Dispute within 60 days, either
                  party may then proceed to file a claim for arbitration in
                  accordance with the Dispute resolution provisions below.

                  The aforementioned Informal Dispute Resolution process,
                  including the written description and personal participation
                  in the meet and confer, is a prerequisite and condition
                  precedent to commencing any formal Dispute resolution
                  proceeding. The parties agree that any relevant limitations
                  period and filing fees or other deadlines will be tolled while
                  the parties engage in this Informal Dispute Resolution
                  process. The parties further agree that whether a complaining
                  party has satisfied these Informal Dispute Resolution
                  procedures, including whether the written description
                  contained all required information, is an issue that can be
                  decided by a court as a prerequisite to arbitration.

                  <strong>Arbitration Procedure.</strong> The Federal
                  Arbitration Act applies to these Terms. Subject to the
                  exceptions listed in Section 14.2(b)(iii) below, any and all
                  Disputes will be resolved by arbitration before a sole
                  arbitrator administered by National Arbitration and Mediation
                  (“NAM”), in accordance with the rules of NAM as modified by
                  these Terms, including, as applicable, NAM Comprehensive
                  Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures, Fees For Disputes
                  When One of the Parties is a Consumer and the Mass Filing
                  Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures in effect at the time
                  any demand for arbitration is filed with NAM, excluding any
                  rules or procedures governing or permitting class or
                  representative actions. If you are initiating arbitration, a
                  copy of the demand shall also be emailed to
                  <a href="mailto:disputes@yahooinc.com"
                    >disputes@yahooinc.com</a
                  >. If you are a registered Yahoo user, any demand initiating
                  arbitration, whether filed by you or Yahoo, must include your
                  Yahoo ID or Yahoo email address. If Yahoo is initiating
                  arbitration, a copy of the demand shall also be sent to the
                  email address(es) or street address(es), if any, that we have
                  in our records at the time the arbitration is initiated.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The arbitrator shall apply New York law consistent with the
                  FAA and applicable statutes of limitations, and shall honor
                  claims of privilege recognized at law. The arbitrator or
                  arbitration body shall be empowered to grant whatever relief
                  would be available in a court under law or in equity. The
                  arbitrator has the right to impose sanctions in accordance
                  with NAM rules and procedures for any frivolous claims or
                  submissions the arbitrator determines have not been filed in
                  good faith, as well as for a party’s failure to comply with
                  the Informal Dispute Resolution clause.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If the amount in controversy does not exceed $10,000 and you
                  do not seek injunctive or declaratory relief, then the
                  arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents
                  you and Yahoo submit to the arbitrator, unless the arbitrator
                  determines that a hearing is necessary or the parties agree
                  otherwise. If the amount in controversy exceeds $10,000 or
                  seeks declaratory or injunctive relief, either party may
                  request (or the arbitrator may determine) to hold a hearing,
                  which shall be via videoconference, unless the parties agree
                  otherwise.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Subject to the applicable NAM rules and procedures, the
                  parties agree that the arbitrator will have the discretion to
                  allow the filing of dispositive motions unless they are
                  unlikely to efficiently resolve or narrow issues in dispute.
                  Unless otherwise prohibited by law, all arbitration
                  proceedings will be confidential and closed to the public and
                  any parties other than you and Yahoo (and each of the parties’
                  authorized representatives and agents), and all records
                  relating thereto will be permanently sealed, except as
                  necessary to obtain court confirmation of the arbitration
                  award (provided that the party seeking confirmation shall seek
                  to file such records under seal to the extent permitted by
                  law).

                  <strong>Batch Arbitration.</strong> To increase the efficiency
                  of administration and resolution of arbitrations, in the event
                  25 or more similar arbitration demands (those asserting the
                  same or substantially similar facts or claims, and seeking the
                  same or substantially similar relief) presented by or with the
                  assistance or coordination of the same law firm(s) or
                  organization(s) are submitted to NAM against either party
                  (“Mass Filing”), the parties agree (i) to administer the Mass
                  Filing in batches of 100 demands per batch (to the extent
                  there are between 25 and 100 demands filed, the batch will
                  consist of all such demands; if fewer than 100 arbitration
                  demands are left over after the batching described above, a
                  final batch will consist of the remaining demands) with only
                  one batch filed, processed, and adjudicated at a time; (ii) to
                  accept applicable fees, including any related fee reduction
                  determined by NAM in its discretion; (iii) that no other
                  demands for arbitration that are part of the Mass Filing may
                  be filed, processed, or adjudicated until selected for
                  inclusion in a set of batch proceedings in accordance with the
                  Terms; (iv) that fees associated with a demand for arbitration
                  included in a Mass Filing, including fees owed by Yahoo and
                  you, shall only be due after your demand for arbitration is
                  included in a set of batch proceedings and that batch is
                  properly designated for filing, processing, and adjudication
                  in accordance with the Terms; and (v) that the staged process
                  of batched proceedings, with each set including 100 demands,
                  shall continue until each demand is adjudicated or resolved or
                  as stated in Section 14.2(b)(iv) below. Arbitrator selection
                  for each batch shall be conducted after the prior batch is
                  adjudicated and to the greatest extent possible in accordance
                  with the applicable NAM rules and procedures for such
                  selection. The arbitrator will determine the location where
                  the proceedings will be conducted. You agree to cooperate in
                  good faith with Yahoo and the arbitration provider to
                  implement such a “batch approach” or other similar approach to
                  provide for an efficient resolution of claims, including the
                  payment of combined reduced fees, set by NAM in its
                  discretion, for each batch of claims. The parties further
                  agree to cooperate with each other and the arbitration
                  provider or arbitrator to establish any other processes or
                  procedures that the arbitration provider or arbitrator believe
                  will provide for an efficient resolution of claims. Any
                  disagreement between the parties as to whether this provision
                  applies or as to the process or procedure for batching shall
                  be resolved by a procedural arbitrator appointed by NAM. This
                  “Batch Arbitration” provision shall in no way be interpreted
                  as increasing the number of claims necessary to trigger the
                  applicability of NAM’s Mass Filing Supplemental Dispute
                  Resolution Rules and Procedures or authorizing class
                  arbitration of any kind. If your demand for arbitration is
                  included in the Mass Filing, your claims will remain tolled
                  until your demand for arbitration is decided, withdrawn, or
                  settled.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The parties agree that this batching provision is integral to
                  the Arbitration Agreement insofar as it applies to a Mass
                  Filing. If the batching provision in this subpart (iii) is
                  found to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, then the
                  entirety of this Arbitration Agreement shall be null and void,
                  and neither you nor Yahoo shall be entitled to arbitrate any
                  claim that is a part of the Mass Filing.

                  >
                  The results of the first batch of demands will be given to a
                  NAM mediator selected from an initially proposed group of 5
                  mediators, with Yahoo and the remaining claimants’ counsel
                  being able to strike one mediator each and then rank the
                  remaining mediators and the highest collectively ranked
                  mediator being selected. The selected mediator will try to
                  facilitate a resolution of the remaining demands in the Mass
                  Filing. After the results are provided to the mediator, Yahoo,
                  the mediator and the remaining claimants will have 90 days
                  (the “Mediation Period”) to agree on a resolution or
                  substantive methodology for resolving the outstanding demands.
                  If they are unable to resolve the outstanding demands during
                  the Mediation Period, and cannot agree on a methodology for
                  resolving them through further arbitrations, either Yahoo or
                  any remaining claimant may opt out of the arbitration process
                  and have the demand(s) proceed in court. Notice of the opt-out
                  will be provided in writing within 60 days of the close of the
                  Mediation Period. If neither Yahoo nor the remaining claimants
                  opt out and they cannot agree to a methodology for resolving
                  the remaining demands through further arbitration, the
                  arbitrations will continue with the batching process. Opt out
                  of arbitration under this section shall not be construed as an
                  opt out of Section 14.2(c), titled “Class Action Waiver For
                  U.S. Users,” below. Absent notice of an opt-out, the
                  arbitrations will proceed in the order determined by the
                  sequential numbers assigned to demands in the Mass Filing.

                  <strong>Arbitrator’s Decision.</strong> The arbitrator’s
                  decision shall be controlled by these Terms. The arbitrator’s
                  decision will include the essential findings and conclusions
                  upon which the arbitrator based the award. Judgment on the
                  arbitration award may be entered in any court having
                  jurisdiction thereof. The arbitrator will have the authority
                  to award monetary damages on an individual basis and to grant,
                  on an individual basis, any non-monetary remedy or relief
                  available to an individual to the extent available under
                  applicable law, the arbitral forum’s rules and this
                  Arbitration Agreement. The parties agree that the damages
                  and/or other relief must be consistent with the terms of the
                  “Limitation of Liability” section of these Terms as to the
                  types and the amounts of damages or other relief for which a
                  party may be held liable. No arbitration award or decision
                  shall have any preclusive effect in other arbitrations, except
                  to preclude the same or similar claims from being
                  re-arbitrated between the same parties. Attorneys’ fees will
                  be available to the prevailing party in the arbitration if
                  authorized under applicable substantive law governing the
                  claims in the arbitration.

                  <strong>Small Claims Court Option.</strong> As an alternative
                  to arbitration, either party may elect to have any claims
                  resolved in small claims court in your county of residence (or
                  if a business, your principal place of business) or New York,
                  New York on an individual basis for disputes and actions
                  within the scope of such court’s jurisdiction, regardless of
                  what forum the filing party initially chose.

                  able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be
                  prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, we will
                  pay any filing and hearing fees in excess of $250 that the
                  arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from
                  being cost-prohibitive regardless of the outcome of the
                  arbitration, unless the arbitrator determines that your
                  claim(s) were frivolous or asserted in bad faith, in which
                  case arbitration fees (including attorneys’ fees) may be
                  imposed upon you consistent with the Arbitrator’s Rules and
                  the standard for sanctions set forth in Federal Rule of Civil
                  Procedure 11. You are responsible for your own attorneys’ fees
                  unless the arbitration rules and/or applicable law provide
                  otherwise, including as set forth in this Arbitration

                  The parties agree that NAM has discretion to reduce the amount
                  or modify the timing of any administrative or arbitration fees
                  due under NAM’s Rules where it deems appropriate (including as
                  specified in subsection (b)(iii) above) provided that such
                  modification does not increase the costs to you, and the
                  parties further agree that they waive any objection to such
                  fee modification. The parties also agree that a good-faith
                  challenge by either party to the fees imposed by NAM does not
                  constitute a default, waiver or breach of this Arbitration
                  Agreement while such challenge remains pending before NAM, the
                  arbitrator, and/or a court of competent jurisdiction, and that
                  any and all due dates for those fees shall be tolled during
                  the pendency of such challenge.

                  Otherwise, you shall be bound to arbitrate disputes in

                  <strong>Changes.</strong> Yahoo reserves the right to make

                  after 30 days and apply to all claims not yet filed regardless
                  of when such claims may have accrued. If Yahoo changes this

                  Agreement (or accepted any subsequent changes to this
                  Arbitration Agreement), you agree that your continued use of
                  the Service 30 days after such change will be deemed
                  acceptance of those changes.

                  <strong>Severability.</strong> If any part of this agreement
                  to arbitrate is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to
                  be unenforceable, the court will reform the agreement to the
                  extent necessary to cure the unenforceable part(s), and the
                  parties will arbitrate their Dispute(s) without reference to
                  or reliance upon the unenforceable part(s). However, if for
                  any reason the Class Action Waiver set forth below in
                  subsection 14.2(c) or the Batch Arbitration provision set
                  forth in subsection 14.2(b)(iii) cannot be enforced as to some
                  or all of the Dispute, then the agreement to arbitrate will
                  not apply to that Dispute or portion thereof. Any Disputes
                  covered by any deemed unenforceable Class Action Waiver
                  provision may only be litigated in a court of competent
                  jurisdiction, but the remainder of the agreement to arbitrate
                  will be binding and enforceable. Further, if any part of this
                  Section 14 is found to prohibit an individual claim seeking
                  public injunctive relief, that provision will have no effect
                  to the extent such relief is allowed to be sought out of
                  arbitration, and the remainder of this Section 14 will be
                  enforceable.

                  <strong>Notice of Dispute.</strong> If either you or
                  we intend to arbitrate under these Terms, the party seeking
                  arbitration must first notify the other party of the Dispute
                  in writing at least 30 days in advance of initiating the
                  arbitration. Notice to us should be sent to us either by mail
                  to Yahoo, Attn: Disputes, 770 Broadway, New York, NY 10003,
                  USA; or

                    >disputes@yahooinc.com</a
                  >. Notice to you will be to your email address(es) and street
                  address(es), if any, that we have in our records at the time
                  the notice is sent. The notice must describe the nature of the
                  claim and the relief being sought. If we are unable to resolve
                  the Dispute within 30 days, either party may then proceed to
                  file a claim for arbitration.

                  <strong>Arbitration Procedure.</strong> The Federal
                  Arbitration Act applies to these Terms. Except for small
                  claims court cases, any and all Disputes will be resolved by
                  arbitration administered by the American Arbitration
                  Association ("AAA"). The AAA will apply the <a
                    href="https://adr.org/sites/default/files/Commercial%20Rules.pdf"
                    >Commercial Arbitration Rules</a
                  > to the arbitration of any Dispute pursuant to these Terms,
                  unless you are an individual and use the Services for personal
                  or household use, in which case the AAA's <a

                    >Consumer Arbitration Rules</a
                  > will apply (excluding any rules or procedures governing or
                  permitting class actions). You can get procedures (including
                  the process for beginning an arbitration), rules and fee
                  information from the AAA (<a href="http://www.adr.org/"
                    >www.adr.org</a
                  >). These Terms govern to the extent they conflict with the
                  AAA’s Commercial Arbitration Rules or Consumer Arbitration
                  Rules.

                  <strong>Small Claims Court Option.</strong> As an alternative
                  to arbitration, you may bring an individual action in small
                  claims court in your county of residence (or if a business,
                  your principal place of business) or Santa Clara County,
                  California provided that your Dispute meets the requirements
                  of the small claims court.

                  <strong>Arbitration Location. </strong>Unless you and we agree
                  otherwise, the arbitration must take place, or the small
                  claims action must be filed, in the county of your primary
                  residence or Santa Clara County, California.

                  <strong>Arbitration Fees and Expenses.</strong> We will
                  reimburse any filing fee that the AAA charges you for
                  arbitration of the Dispute. If you provide us with signed
                  written notice that you cannot pay the filing fee, we will pay
                  the fee directly to the AAA. If the arbitration proceeds, we
                  will also pay any administrative and arbitrator fees charged
                  later.

              <li>
                <p>
                  <strong>Settlement Offers.</strong> We may, but are not
                  obligated to, make a written settlement offer anytime before
                  or during arbitration. The amount or terms of any settlement
                  offer may not be disclosed to the arbitrator unless and until
                  the arbitrator issues an award on the claim. If you do not
                  accept the offer and the arbitrator awards you an amount of
                  money that is more than our offer but less than $5,000, we
                  agree to: (a) pay you $5,000 instead of the lower amount
                  awarded, (b) pay your reasonable attorney’s fees and costs,
                  and (c) reimburse any arbitration filing fees and arbitrator
                  fees and expenses incurred in connection with the arbitration
                  of your Dispute. If the arbitrator awards you more than $5,000
                  and we are not challenging the award, then we will pay you the
                  amount of the award.

                  <strong>Severability.</strong> If any part of this agreement
                  to arbitrate is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to
                  be unenforceable, the court will reform the agreement to the
                  extent necessary to cure the unenforceable part(s), and the
                  parties will arbitrate their Dispute(s) without reference to
                  or reliance upon the unenforceable part(s). However, if for
                  any reason the Class Action Waiver set forth below in
                  subsection 14.3.c cannot be enforced as to some or all of the
                  Dispute, then the agreement to arbitrate will not apply to
                  that Dispute or portion thereof. Any Disputes covered by any
                  deemed unenforceable Class Action Waiver provision may only be
                  litigated in a court of competent jurisdiction, but the
                  remainder of the agreement to arbitrate will be binding and
                  enforceable. To avoid any doubt or uncertainty, the parties do
                  not agree to class arbitration or to the arbitration of any
                  claims brought on behalf of others.
