<p>
  This agreement is between you or the entity you represent and Microsoft
  Corporation, and consists of the terms below, Exhibit A, terms incorporated by
  reference, terms applicable to other Microsoft web sites and services that you
  use and are necessary to use the Services (for example, your Microsoft
  Account), Microsoft API Terms, and the Privacy Statement (together, the
  “Agreement”). If you are entering into this Agreement on behalf of an entity,
  such as your employer, you represent that you have the legal authority to bind
  that entity. If you specify a company name in connection with signing up for
  or ordering a Service, you will be deemed to have placed that order and to
  have entered into this Agreement on behalf of that organization or company.
  Key terms are defined in Section 11. By accepting this Agreement, you agree to
  these terms. If you do not accept and comply with this Agreement, you may not
  use the Services.
</p>
<a href="#1-services"></a>
<h4>1. Services.</h4>
<p>
  a. <strong>Right to use.</strong> We grant you the right to access and use the
  Services in accordance with this Agreement to design, develop, and test your
  applications to make them available for your Microsoft 365 online services,
  on-premises deployments or for the Microsoft In-product Store and/or
  AppSource. You may not use the Services for production use.
</p>
<p>
  b. <strong>User Plan.</strong> Each user of the Microsoft 365 Developer
  portion of the Developer Services must be allocated an individual User Plan,
  whether they access the service directly or indirectly. You are entitled to
  <strong>one</strong> free subscription to Microsoft 365 Developer under this
  Agreement.
</p>
<p>c. <strong>Manner of use.</strong> You may not:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      i. reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble or work around technical
      limitations in the Services, except to the extent that applicable law
      permits it despite these limitations;
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      ii. disable, tamper with or otherwise attempt to circumvent any mechanism
      that limits your use of the Services;
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      iii. rent, lease, lend, resell, transfer, or sublicense any Services or
      portion thereof to or for third parties, except as explicitly permitted
      herein or in license terms that accompany any Services component;
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      iv. use the Services for any purpose that is unlawful or prohibited by
      this Agreement; or
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      v. use the Services in any manner that could damage, disable, overburden,
      or impair any Microsoft service, or the network(s) connected to any
      Microsoft service, or interfere with any other party’s use and enjoyment
      of any Services.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  d. <strong>Updates.</strong> We may make changes to the Services from time to
  time, including: the availability of features; how long, how much or how often
  any given feature may be used; and feature dependencies upon other services or
  software.
</p>
<p>
  e. <strong>Preview features.</strong> We may make features available on a
  Preview basis. Previews are provided “AS-IS”. Previews may be subject to
  reduced or different security, compliance, privacy, availability, reliability,
  and support commitments, as further explained in the Privacy Statement, and
  any additional notices provided with the Preview. We may change or discontinue
  Previews at any time without notice. We also may choose not to release a
  Preview into “General Availability”.
</p>
<a href="#2-software"></a>
<h4>2. Software.</h4>
<p>
  a. <strong>Using Microsoft Software outside the Service.</strong> Microsoft
  may provide you with Microsoft Software through or as a part of the Developer
  Services. Termination of use of or access to the Developer Services or the
  termination of this Agreement terminates your right to possess or use any such
  Microsoft Software; and the suspension or termination of a User Plan
  terminates that user’s right to possess or use any such Microsoft Software
  that was acquired through, is attached to, or otherwise requires that User
  Plan. You must delete all copies of such Microsoft Software licensed under
  this Agreement and destroy any associated media upon the termination of the
  associated possession or usage rights. Microsoft may provide you with
  Microsoft Software for use outside the Developer Services and with (1) the
  Developer Services or (2) programs you develop using the Developer Services.
  If the Microsoft Software is provided with its own license terms, those
  license terms control provided that they are modified by the preceding portion
  of this Section 2(a) in case of conflict. If the Microsoft Software does not
  have its own license terms, then you may install and use any number of copies
  of the Microsoft Software to design, develop, and test your applications. This
  subsection does not apply to Microsoft Software addressed in subsection (b)
  below.
</p>
<p>
  b. <strong>Software on Documentation Portal.</strong> Software accessible on
  the Documentation Portal is made available by the designated publisher under
  the associated license terms. If Microsoft Software is accessible on the
  Documentation Portal without license terms, then subject to subsection (c)
  below you may use it to design, develop, and test your applications. If any
  such Microsoft Software without license terms is marked as “sample” or
  “example,” then you may use it under the terms of the MIT License.
</p>
<p>
  c. <strong>Scope of rights.</strong> All Microsoft Software are the
  copyrighted works of Microsoft or its suppliers. All Microsoft Software are
  licensed not sold and may not be transferred unless specified otherwise in any
  license terms provided with the Microsoft Software. Rights to access Microsoft
  Software on any device do not give you any right to implement Microsoft
  patents or other Microsoft intellectual property in software or devices that
  access that device.
</p>
<p>
  d. <strong>Third party software.</strong> You are solely responsible for any
  third party software that you install, connect, or use with any Service. We
  will not run or make any copies of such third party software outside of our
  relationship with you. You may only install or use any third party software
  with any Service in a way that does not subject our intellectual property or
  technology to any terms governing such software. We are not a party to and are
  not bound by any terms governing your use of any third party software. We do
  not grant any licenses or rights, express or implied, to such third party
  software.
</p>
<p>
  e. <strong>Open source software as part of the Service.</strong> If the
  Service uses or distributes any third party software with open source software
  license terms (“Open Source”), then such Open Source is licensed to you by
  Microsoft solely to allow you to interact with the Service under terms of this
  Agreement. Copies of those applicable Open Source licenses and any other
  notices, if any, are included for your information only.
</p>
<p>
  f. <strong>Application programming interfaces.</strong> Microsoft will not
  assert any of its patent rights on account of your products calling
  application programming interfaces that it publishes on the Documentation
  Portal (“APIs”) in order to receive services from the Microsoft product that
  exposes the APIs.
</p>
<a href="#3-microsoft-content"></a>
<h4>3. Microsoft Content.</h4>
<p>
  All Microsoft Content is the copyrighted work of Microsoft or its suppliers,
  and is governed by the terms of the license agreement that accompanies or is
  included with the Microsoft Content. If the Microsoft Content is made
  available to you on the Documentation Portal without a license agreement, then
  you may make a reasonable number of copies of the Microsoft Content for your
  internal use in designing, developing, and testing your applications. You must
  preserve the copyright notice in all copies of the Microsoft Content and
  ensure that both the copyright notice and this permission notice appear in
  those copies. Accredited educational institutions, such as K-12 schools,
  universities, and private or public colleges may download and reproduce
  Microsoft Content for distribution in the classroom for educational purposes.
</p>
<a href="#4-security-privacy-and-customer-data"></a>
<h4>4. Security, privacy, and Customer Data.</h4>
<p>
  a. <strong>Security.</strong> We maintain technical and organizational
  measures, internal controls, and data security routines intended to protect
  Customer Data against accidental loss or change, unauthorized disclosure or
  access, or unlawful destruction.
</p>
<p>
  b. <strong>Privacy and data location.</strong> We treat Customer Data in
  accordance with the terms herein and our Privacy Statement. We may transfer
  to, store, and process Customer Data in the United States or in any country
  where we or our Affiliates or subcontractors have facilities used for
  Developer Services. You will obtain any necessary consent or rights from end
  users or others whose data or personal information or other data you will be
  hosting in the Services.
</p>
<p>
  c. <strong>Rights to Provide Customer Data.</strong> You are solely
  responsible for your Customer Data. You must have, and you hereby grant us,
  sufficient rights to use and distribute Customer Data (including Customer Data
  sourced from third parties) necessary for us to provide you the Developer
  Services without violating the rights of any third party, or otherwise
  obligating Microsoft to you or to any third party. We do not assume any
  additional obligations that may apply to Customer Data except as required by
  applicable law.
</p>
<p>
  d. <strong>Ownership of Customer Data.</strong> Except for software and
  Content we license to you, as between the parties, you retain all right, title
  and interest in and to Customer Data. We acquire no rights in Customer Data
  other than as described in this Section 4.
</p>
<p>
  e. <strong>Use of Customer Data.</strong> The Services transmit Customer Data
  to us, including usage and performance data and crash dumps you choose to
  send. We will use Customer Data to provide the Services. This use may include
  troubleshooting to prevent, find and fix problems with the operation of the
  Services and ensuring compliance with this Agreement. It may also include:
  providing you with suggestions to help you discover and use functionality
  within the Services; improving the features of our Services; and otherwise use
  patterns, trends, and other statistical data derived from Customer Data to
  provide, operate, maintain, and improve our products and services. We will not
  use Customer Data or derive information from it for any (1) advertising or (2)
  other commercial purposes (beyond providing you with the Services) without
  your consent.
</p>
<p>
  f. <strong>Customer Data return and deletion.</strong> You may delete your
  Customer Data at any time. If you terminate your account we may delete
  Customer Data immediately without any retention period. We have no additional
  obligation to continue to hold, export, or return Customer Data and have no
  liability whatsoever for deletion of Customer Data pursuant to this Agreement.
</p>
<p>
  g. <strong>Third party requests of Customer Data.</strong> We will not
  disclose Customer Data to a third party (including law enforcement, other
  government entity, or civil litigant, but excluding our subcontractors) except
  as you direct or unless required by law. We will ask any third party demanding
  access to your Customer Data to contact you directly using your basic contact
  information. We will promptly notify you and provide a copy of the demand
  unless legally prohibited. You are responsible for responding to requests by a
  third party regarding your use of Services.
</p>
<p>
  h. <strong>Subcontractors.</strong> We may hire other companies to provide
  limited services on our behalf, such as customer support. Any such
  subcontractors will be permitted to obtain Customer Data only to deliver the
  services we have retained them to provide. We remain responsible for our
  subcontractors’ compliance with the obligations set forth in this Agreement.
</p>
<p>
  i. <strong>Compliance with law.</strong> We will comply with all laws
  applicable to our provision of the Services, including applicable security
  breach notification laws, but not including any laws applicable to you or your
  industry that are not generally applicable to information technology services
  providers. You will comply with all laws applicable to your Customer Data, and
  use of the Services, including any laws applicable to you or your industry.
</p>
<p>
  j. <strong>Certifications and compliance.</strong> The Developer Services
  shall be subject to any security, privacy, and compliance practices
  specifically described for the Developer Services at the Developer Services
  Portal. These obligations do not apply to any other elements of the Services.
</p>
<p>
  k. <strong>Claims of infringement.</strong> We will inform you if we receive
  notice claiming that your usage of the Service infringes a third party’s
  intellectual property rights, and in such instances we may provide your basic
  contact information to the third party. You will promptly respond to such
  complaints.

></a>
<h4>
  5. Customer accounts, customer conduct, identity services, and feedback.
</h4>
<p>
  a. <strong>Account creation.</strong> If any of the Services requires you to
  open an account, you must complete the registration process by providing us
  with current, complete and accurate information. You must be the age of
  consent or older to create an account. You may not select an account user name
  or identifier that impersonates someone else, is or may be illegal, or may be
  protected by trademark or other proprietary rights, is vulgar or offensive or
  may cause confusion. We reserve the right to reject and/or reassign these user
  names and Service identifiers in our sole discretion. Each individual is
  entitled to one account to use with these Services and a user may not register
  for an additional account using other information. If a user creates multiple
  accounts, Microsoft may suspend or delete such additional accounts at its
  discretion.
</p>
<p>
  b. <strong>Responsibility for your accounts.</strong> You are responsible for:
  any and all activities that occur under your account; maintaining the
  confidentiality of any non-public authentication credentials associated with
  your use of the Services; and promptly notifying our customer support team
  about any possible misuse of your accounts or authentication credentials, or
  any security incident related to the Services.
</p>
<p>
  c.
  <strong
    >Your conduct and the availability of third party content and links to third
    party content</strong
  >. For any public, community interaction you undertake on the Services you
  must follow the Microsoft Community Code of Conduct. We have no obligation to
  monitor the content and communications of third parties on the Services;
  however, we reserve the right to review and remove any such materials posted
  to the Documentation Portal in our sole discretion. Third parties that
  participate on the Services are not authorized Microsoft spokespersons, and
  their views do not necessarily reflect those of Microsoft.
</p>
<p>
  d. <strong>Identity usage across Services.</strong> We may provide Services
  that supplement Microsoft Software and rely upon your user account or other
  identity mechanism. We may use this information to identify you and authorize
  access to Microsoft Content, Microsoft Software, and other resources across
  the Services.
</p>
<p>
  e. <strong>Submissions and feedback.</strong> We do not claim ownership of any
  Submission unless otherwise agreed to by the parties. However, by providing a
  Submission, you are irrevocably granting Microsoft and its Affiliates the
  right to make, use, modify, distribute and otherwise commercialize the
  Submission in any way and for any purpose (including by granting the general
  public the right to use your Submissions in accordance with this Agreement,
  which may change over time). For Submissions provided to the Documentation
  Portal you further grant the right to publish specific identifying information
  detailed in the Privacy Statement in connection with your Submission. These
  rights are granted under all applicable intellectual property rights you own
  or control. No compensation will be paid with respect to the use of your
  Submissions. Microsoft is under no obligation to post or use any Submission,
  and Microsoft may remove any Submission at any time. By providing a Submission
  you warrant that you own or otherwise control all of the rights to your
  Submission and that your Submission is not subject to any rights of a third
  party (including any personality or publicity rights of any person).
</p>
<p>
  f. <strong>Services accessible only to invited customers.</strong> Elements of
  the Services may be accessible to you on an invitation only basis, for example
  as part of a program for using pre-release Services and providing feedback to
  us (e.g., through the “Connect” portal). Those Services are confidential
  information of Microsoft. You may not disclose this confidential information
  to any third party for a period of five years. This restriction does not apply
  to any information that is or becomes publicly available without a breach of
  this restriction, was lawfully known to the receiver of the information
  without an obligation to keep it confidential, is received from another source
  who can disclose it lawfully and without an obligation to keep it
  confidential, or is independently developed. You may disclose this
  confidential information if required to comply with a court order or other
  government demand that has the force of law. Before doing so, you must seek
  the highest level of protection available and, when possible, give us enough
  prior notice to provide a reasonable chance to seek a protective order.
</p>
<a href="#6-term-termination-and-suspension"></a>
<h4>6. Term, termination, and suspension.</h4>
<p>
  a. <strong>Agreement term and termination.</strong> The term of this Agreement
  begins when you accept it. You may terminate this Agreement at any time by
  deleting your profile at

  >. Upon termination of this Agreement your contact information and preferences
  will be removed; your optional free subscription to Microsoft 365 Developer
  obtained under this Agreement will end and your access to Developer Services
  will end.
</p>
<p>
  b. <strong>Regulatory.</strong> In any country where any current or future
  government regulation or requirement that applies to us, but not generally to
  businesses operating there, presents a hardship to us operating the Services
  without change, and/or causes us to believe this Agreement or the Services may
  be in conflict with any such regulation or requirement, we may change the
  Services or terminate the Agreement. Your sole remedy for such changes to the
  Services under this Section is to terminate this Agreement.
</p>
<p>
  c. <strong>Suspension or Termination.</strong> We may suspend or terminate
  your use of the Services if: (1) reasonably needed to prevent unauthorized
  access to Customer Data; (2) you fail to respond to a claim of alleged
  infringement under Sections 4.k or 8 within a reasonable time; (3) you violate
  this Agreement; or (4) we suspect fraud. We will attempt to suspend access to
  the minimum necessary part of the Services while the condition or need exists.
  We will give notice before we suspend, except where we reasonably believe we
  need to suspend or terminate immediately. If you do not fully address the
  reasons for the suspension within 60 days after we suspend, we may terminate
  this Agreement and delete your Customer Data without any retention period. We
  may also terminate your account if your use of the Developer Services is
  suspended more than twice in any 12-month period.
</p>
<p>
  d.
  <strong
    >Suspension or termination of Microsoft 365 Developer subscription for
    non-usage.</strong
  >
  We may suspend or terminate your optional free Microsoft 365 Developer
  subscription obtained under this Agreement and delete any Customer Data
  related to it if you fail to use your subscription to design, develop or test
  applications for Microsoft 365, or if you otherwise fail to comply with any
  milestones or other requirements that we may communicate to you (e.g., through
  the Developer Services Portal), within any period of 90 consecutive days
  during the term of this Agreement. We will provide you with notice prior to
  any suspension or termination of your subscription and Customer Data deletion.

  >
</p>
<a href="#8-defense-of-claims"></a>
<h4>8. Defense of claims.</h4>
<p>
  a. <strong>Defense.</strong> We will defend you against any claims made by an
  unaffiliated third party that the Developer Services or Developer Services
  Software infringe its patent, copyright or trademark or makes unlawful use of
  its trade secret. You will defend us against any claims made by an
  unaffiliated third party that any (1) Non-Microsoft Product that is not made
  available through the Developer Services or Developer Services Software or (2)
  Customer Data you provide directly or indirectly in using the Services
  infringe the third party’s patent, copyright, or trademark or makes unlawful
  use of its trade secret.
</p>
<p>
  b. <strong>Limitations.</strong> Our obligations in Section 8.a will not apply
  to a claim or award based on: (1) Customer Data, Non-Microsoft Product,
  modifications you make to the Services, or materials you provide or make
  available as part of using the Services; (2) your combination of the Services
  with, or damages based upon the value of, a Non-Microsoft Product, data or
  business process; (3) your use of a Microsoft trademark without our express
  written consent, or your use of the Services after we notify you to stop due
  to a third-party claim; or (4) your redistribution of the Services to, or use
  for the benefit of, any unaffiliated third party.
</p>
<p>
  c. <strong>Remedies.</strong> If we reasonably believe that a claim under
  Section 8.a may bar your use of the Developer Services or Developer Services
  Software, we will seek to: (1) obtain the right for you to keep using it; or
  (2) modify or replace it with a functional equivalent. If these options are
  not commercially reasonable, we may terminate your rights to use the Developer
  Services or Developer Services Software.
</p>
<p>
  d. <strong>Obligations.</strong> Each party must notify the other promptly of
  a claim under this Section 8. The party seeking protection must (1) give the
  other sole control over the defense and settlement of the claim; and (2) give
  reasonable help in defending the claim. The party providing the protection
  will (1) reimburse the other for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses that it
  incurs in giving that help and (2) pay the amount of any resulting adverse
  final judgment (or settlement that the other consents to). The parties’
  respective rights to defense and payment of judgments or settlements under
  this Section are in lieu of any common law or statutory indemnification rights
  or analogous rights, and each party waives such common law rights.

    POSSIBLE.</strong
  >
</p>
<p>
  c. <strong>Exceptions to Limitations.</strong> The limits of liability in this
  Section apply to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, but do not
  apply to: (1) the parties’ obligations under Section 8 (Defense of claims); or
  (2) breach of any confidentiality obligation; or (3) violation of the other's
  intellectual property rights.
