  The Microsoft Services Agreement is an agreement between you and Microsoft (or
  one of its affiliates) that governs your use of Microsoft consumer online
  products and services.

<h2>Your Privacy</h2>
<p>
  1. <strong>Your Privacy.</strong> Your privacy is important to us. Please read
  the
  <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=521839" target="_blank"
    >Microsoft Privacy Statement</a
  >
  (https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=521839) (the "<strong
    >Privacy Statement</strong
  >") as it describes the types of data we collect from you and your devices
  ("<strong>Data</strong>"), how we use your Data, and the legal bases we have
  to process your Data. The Privacy Statement also describes how Microsoft uses
  your content, which is your communications with others; postings submitted by
  you to Microsoft via the Services; and the files, photos, documents, audio,
  digital works, livestreams and videos that you upload, store, broadcast,
  create, generate, or share through the Services or inputs that you submit in
  order to generate content ("<strong>Your Content</strong>"). Where processing
  is based on consent and to the extent permitted by law, by agreeing to these
  Terms, you consent to Microsoft’s collection, use and disclosure of Your
  Content and Data as described in the Privacy Statement. In some cases, we will
  provide separate notice and request your consent as referenced in the Privacy
  Statement.
</p>
<h2>Your Content</h2>
<p>
  2. <strong>Your Content.</strong> Many of our Services allow you to create,
  store or share Your Content or receive material from others. We don’t claim
  ownership of Your Content. Your Content remains yours and you are responsible
  for it.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    a. When you share Your Content with other people, you understand that they
    may be able to, on a worldwide basis, use, save, record, reproduce,
    broadcast, transmit, share and display Your Content for the purpose that you
    made Your Content available on the Services without compensating you. If you
    do not want others to have that ability, do not use the Services to share
    Your Content. You represent and warrant that for the duration of these
    Terms, you have (and will have) all the rights necessary for Your Content
    that is uploaded, stored, or shared on or through the Services and that the
    collection, use, and retention of Your Content will not violate any law or
    rights of others. Microsoft cannot be held responsible for Your Content or
    the material others upload, store or share using the Services.
  </li>
  <li>
    b. To the extent necessary to provide the Services to you and others, to
    protect you and the Services, and to improve Microsoft products and
    services, you grant to Microsoft a worldwide and royalty-free intellectual
    property license to use Your Content, for example, to make copies of,
    retain, transmit, reformat, display, and distribute via communication tools
    Your Content on the Services. If you publish Your Content in areas of the
    Service where it is available broadly online without restrictions, Your
    Content may appear in demonstrations or materials that promote the Service.
    Some of the Services are supported by advertising. Controls for how
    Microsoft personalizes advertising are available at
    <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=286759" target="_blank"
      >https://choice.live.com</a
    >
    (https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=286759). We do not use what you say
    in email, chat, video calls or voice mail, or your documents, photos or
    other personal files, to target advertising to you. Our advertising policies
    are covered in detail in the Privacy Statement.
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Code of Conduct</h2>
<p>
  3. <strong>Code of Conduct.</strong> You are accountable for your conduct and
  content when using the Services.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    a. By agreeing to these Terms, you’re agreeing that, when using the
    Services, you will follow these rules:
    <ul>
      <li>
        i. Don’t do anything illegal, or try to generate or share content that
        is illegal.
      </li>
      <li>
        ii. Don’t engage in any activity that exploits, harms, or threatens to
        harm children.
      </li>
      <li>
        iii. Don’t send spam or engage in phishing, or try to generate or
        distribute malware. Spam is unwanted or unsolicited bulk email,
        postings, contact requests, SMS (text messages), instant messages, or
        similar electronic communications. Phishing is sending emails or other
        electronic communications to fraudulently or unlawfully induce
        recipients to reveal personal or sensitive information, such as
        passwords, dates of birth, Social Security numbers, passport numbers,
        credit card information, financial information, or other sensitive
        information, or to gain access to accounts or records, exfiltration of
        documents or other sensitive information, payment and/or financial
        benefit. Malware includes any activity designed to cause technical harm,
        such as delivering malicious executables, organizing denial of service
        attacks or managing command and control servers.
      </li>
      <li>
        iv. Don’t publicly display or use the Services to generate or share
        inappropriate content or material (involving, for example, nudity,
        bestiality, pornography, offensive language, graphic violence,
        self-harm, or criminal activity).
      </li>
      <li>
        v. Don’t engage in activity that is fraudulent, false or misleading
        (e.g., asking for money under false pretenses, impersonating someone
        else, creating fake accounts, automating inauthentic activity,
        generating or sharing content that is intentionally deceptive,
        manipulating the Services to increase play count, or affect rankings,
        ratings, or comments).
      </li>
      <li>
        vi. Don’t circumvent any restrictions on access to, usage, or
        availability of the Services (e.g., attempting to “jailbreak” an AI
        system or impermissible scraping).
      </li>
      <li>
        vii. Don’t engage in activity that is harmful to you, the Services, or
        others (e.g., transmitting viruses, stalking, trying to generate or
        sharing content that harasses, bullies or threatens others, posting
        terrorist or violent extremist content, communicating hate speech, or
        advocating violence against others).
      </li>
      <li>
        viii. Don’t violate or infringe upon the rights of others (e.g.,
        unauthorized sharing of copyrighted music or other copyrighted material,
        resale or other distribution of Bing maps, or taking photographs or
        video/audio recordings of others without their consent for processing of
        an individual’s biometric identifiers/information or any other purpose
        using any of the Services).
      </li>
      <li>ix. Don’t engage in activity that violates the privacy of others.</li>
      <li>x. Don’t help others break these rules.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>

    and service specific terms is available at

    >.
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Using the Services &amp; Support</h2>
<p>4. <strong>Using the Services &amp; Support.</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>
    a. <strong>Microsoft account.</strong> You’ll need a Microsoft account to
    access many of the Services. Your Microsoft account lets you sign in to
    products, websites and services provided by Microsoft and some Microsoft
    partners.
    <ul>
      <li>
        i. <strong>Creating an Account.</strong> You can create a Microsoft
        account by signing up online. You agree not to use any false, inaccurate
        or misleading information when signing up for your Microsoft account. In
        some cases, a third party, like your Internet service provider, may have
        assigned a Microsoft account to you. If you received your Microsoft
        account from a third party, the third party may have additional rights
        over your account, like the ability to access or delete your Microsoft
        account. Please review any additional terms the third party provided
        you, as Microsoft has no responsibility regarding these additional
        terms. If you create a Microsoft account on behalf of an entity, such as
        your business or employer, you represent that you have the legal
        authority to bind that entity to these Terms. You cannot transfer your
        Microsoft account credentials to another user or entity. To protect your
        account, keep your account details and password confidential. You are
        responsible for all activity that occurs under your Microsoft account.
      </li>
      <li>
        ii. <strong>Account Use.</strong> You must use your Microsoft account to
        keep it active. This means you must sign in at least once in a two-year
        period to keep your Microsoft account, and associated Services, active,
        unless a longer period is provided in the Microsoft account activity
        policy at
        <a
          href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2086738"
          target="_blank"
          >https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2086738</a
        >
        or in an offer for a paid portion of the Services. If you don’t sign in
        during this time, we will assume your Microsoft account is inactive and
        will close it for you. Please see section 4.a.iv.2 for the consequences
        of a closed Microsoft account. You must sign into your Outlook.com inbox
        and your OneDrive (separately) at least once in a one-year period,
        otherwise we will close your Outlook.com inbox and your OneDrive for
        you. If we reasonably suspect that your Microsoft account is at risk of
        being used by a third party fraudulently (for example, as a result of an
        account compromise), Microsoft may suspend your account until you can
        reclaim ownership. Based on the nature of the compromise, we may be
        required to disable access to some or all of Your Content. If you are
        having trouble accessing your Microsoft account, please visit this
        website:
        <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=238656" target="_blank"
          >https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=238656</a
        >.
      </li>
      <li>
        iii. <strong>Kids and Accounts.</strong> By creating a Microsoft account
        or using the Services, you accept and agree to be bound by these Terms
        and represent that you have either reached the age of "majority" where
        you live or your parent or legal guardian agrees to be bound by these
        Terms on your behalf. If you do not know whether you have reached the
        age of majority where you live, or do not understand this section,
        please ask your parent or legal guardian for help. If you are the parent
        or legal guardian of a minor, you and the minor accept and agree to be
        bound by these Terms and are responsible for all use of the Microsoft
        account or Services, including purchases, whether the minor’s account is
        now open or created later.
      </li>
      <li>
        iv. <strong>Closing Your Account.</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>
            1. You can cancel specific Services or close your Microsoft account
            at any time and for any reason. To close your Microsoft account,
            please visit
            <a href="https://account.live.com/closeaccount.aspx" target="_blank"
              >https://account.live.com/closeaccount.aspx</a
            >. When you ask us to close your Microsoft account, you can choose
            to put it in a suspended state for either 30 or 60 days just in case
            you change your mind. After that 30- or 60-day period, your
            Microsoft account will be closed. Please see section 4.a.iv.2 below
            for an explanation as to what happens when your Microsoft account is
            closed. Logging back in during the suspension period will reactivate
            your Microsoft account.
          </li>
          <li>
            2. If your Microsoft account is closed (whether by you or us), a few
            things happen. First, your right to use the Microsoft account to
            access the Services stops immediately. Second, we’ll delete Data or
            Your Content associated with your Microsoft account or will
            otherwise disassociate it from you and your Microsoft account
            (unless we are required by law to keep it, return it, or transfer it
            to you or a third party identified by you). You should have a
            regular backup plan as Microsoft won’t be able to retrieve Your
            Content or Data once your account is closed. Third, you may lose
            access to products you’ve acquired.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    b. <strong>Moderation and Enforcement.</strong> Many of our Services that
    allow you to interact, create, generate, and share content with others
    leverage safety systems to protect our Services and other users.
    <ul>
      <li>
        i. <strong>Policies.</strong> Our
        <a href="#3_codeOfConduct">Code of Conduct</a> identifies what’s
        prohibited when using our Services. Our content and conduct policies can
        be found
        <a
          href="https://www.microsoft.com/DigitalSafety/policies"
          target="_blank"
          >here</a
        >
        (https://www.microsoft.com/DigitalSafety/policies). Specific Services
        have additional policies and community standards applicable to their
        users, which are available
        <a
          href="https://www.microsoft.com/DigitalSafety/policies/additional-guidelines"
          target="_blank"
          >here</a
        >
        (https://www.microsoft.com/DigitalSafety/policies/additional-guidelines).
      </li>
      <li>
        ii. <strong>Reporting a Concern.</strong> You can report concerning
        content or conduct that may violate our Code of Conduct
        <a href="https://aka.ms/reportconcerns" target="_blank">here</a>
        (https://aka.ms/reportconcerns).
      </li>
      <li>
        iii. <strong>Review.</strong> Where applicable, we may use automated
        systems and humans to review content to identify suspected spam,
        viruses, fraud, phishing, malware, jailbreaking, or other illegal or
        harmful content or conduct.
      </li>
      <li>
        iv. <strong>Enforcement.</strong> We reserve the right to deny content
        if it exceeds limits on storage or file size allowed by the Service. We
        may block, remove or decline to display content if it appears to violate
        our Code of Conduct or another Service policy or where required by law.
        If you violate these terms or
        <a href="https://aka.ms/trustandsafety" target="_blank">Policies</a>
        (https://aka.ms/trustandsafety), we may take action against your
        account. This could include limiting access to certain features or
        Services, stopping providing Services, closing your Microsoft account
        immediately or blocking delivery of a communication (like email, file
        sharing or instant message) to or from the Services. Closure of your
        access to a Service or your account may result in forfeiture of content
        licenses, associated content, memberships, and Microsoft account
        balances associated with the account. When reviewing alleged violations
        of these Terms, Microsoft reserves the right to review content to
        resolve the issue. However, we cannot monitor the entire Services and
        make no attempt to do so. For more information about the

        property infringement may be found at <a href="#NOTICES">NOTICES</a>.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    c. <strong>Work or School Accounts.</strong> You can sign into certain
    Microsoft services with a work or school email address. If you do, you agree
    that the owner of the domain associated with your email address may be
    notified of the existence of your Microsoft account and its associated
    subscriptions, control and administer your account, and access and process
    your Data, including the contents of your communications and files, and that
    Microsoft may notify the owner of the domain if the account or Data is
    compromised. You further agree that your use of the Microsoft services may
    be subject to the agreements Microsoft has with you or your organization and
    these Terms may not apply. If you already have a Microsoft account and you
    use a separate work or school email address to access Services covered under
    these Terms, you may be prompted to update the email address associated with
    your Microsoft account in order to continue accessing such Services.
  </li>
  <li>
    d. <strong>Additional Equipment/Data Plans.</strong> To use many of the
    Services, you’ll need an internet connection and/or data/cellular plan. You
    might also need additional equipment, like a headset, camera or microphone.
    You are responsible for providing all connections, plans, and equipment
    needed to use the Services and for paying the fees charged by the
    provider(s) of your connections, plans, and equipment. Those fees are in
    addition to any fees you pay us for the Services and we will not reimburse
    you for such fees. Check with your provider(s) to determine if there are any
    such fees that may apply to you.
  </li>
  <li>
    e. <strong>Service Notifications.</strong> When there’s something we need to
    tell you about a Service you use, we’ll send you Service notifications. If
    you gave us your email address or phone number in connection with your
    Microsoft account, then we may send Service notifications to you via email
    or via SMS (text message), including to verify your identity before
    registering your mobile phone number and verifying your purchases. We may
    also send you Service notifications by other means (for example by
    in-product messages).
    <strong
      >Data or messaging rates may apply when receiving notifications via
      SMS.</strong
    >
  </li>
  <li>
    f. <strong>Support.</strong> Customer support for some Services is available
    at
    <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/" target="_blank"
      >https://support.microsoft.com</a
    >. Certain Services may offer separate or additional customer support,
    subject to the terms available at
    <a
      href="https://www.microsoft.com/support-service-agreement"
      target="_blank"
      >https://microsoft.com/support-service-agreement</a
    >, unless otherwise specified. Support may not be available for preview or
    beta versions of features or Services.
  </li>
  <li>
    g. <strong>Ending your Services.</strong> If your Services are canceled
    (whether by you or us), first your right to access the Services stops
    immediately and your license to the software related to the Services ends.
    Second, we’ll delete Data or Your Content associated with your Service or
    will otherwise disassociate it from you and your Microsoft account (unless
    we are required by law to keep it, return it, or transfer it to you or a
    third party identified by you). As a result you may no longer be able to
    access any of the Services (or Your Content that you’ve stored on those
    Services). You should have a regular backup plan. Third, you may lose access
    to products you’ve acquired. If you have canceled your Microsoft account and
    have no other account able to access the Services your Services may be
    canceled immediately.
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Using Third-Party Apps and Services</h2>
<p>
  5. <strong>Using Third-Party Apps and Services.</strong> The Services may
  allow you to access or acquire products, services, websites, links, content,
  material, games, skills, integrations, bots or applications from independent
  third parties (companies or people who aren’t Microsoft) (<strong
    >"Third-Party Apps and Services"</strong
  >). Many of our Services also help you find, make requests to, or interact
  with Third-Party Apps and Services and may allow or require you to share Your
  Content or Data with such Third-Party Apps and Services, and you understand
  that by using our Services you are directing them to make Third-Party Apps and
  Services available to you. The Third-Party Apps and Services may allow or
  require you to store Your Content or Data with the publisher, provider or
  operator of the Third-Party Apps and Services. The Third-Party Apps and
  Services may present you with a privacy policy or require you to accept their
  terms before you can install or use the Third-Party App or Service. See
  section 13.b for additional terms for applications acquired through certain
  Stores owned or operated by Microsoft or its affiliates (including, but not
  limited to, the Office Store, the Microsoft Store on Xbox and the Microsoft
  Store on Windows. You should review the third-party terms and privacy policies
  before acquiring, using, requesting, or linking your Microsoft Account to any
  Third-Party Apps and Services. Any third-party terms do not modify these
  Terms. Microsoft does not license any intellectual property to you as part of
  any Third-Party Apps and Services. You agree to assume all risk and liability
  arising from your use of these Third-Party Apps and Services and that
  Microsoft is not responsible for any issues arising out of your use of them.
  Microsoft is not responsible or liable to you or others for information or
  services provided by any Third-Party Apps and Services.
</p>
<h2>Service Availability</h2>
<p>6. <strong>Service Availability.</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>
    a. The Services, Third-Party Apps and Services, or material or products
    offered through the Services may be unavailable from time to time, may be
    offered for a limited time, or may vary depending on your region or device.
    If you change the location associated with your Microsoft account, you may
    need to re-acquire the material or applications that were available to you
    and paid for in your previous region.
  </li>
  <li>
    b. We strive to keep the Services up and running; however, all online
    services suffer occasional disruptions and outages, and Microsoft is not
    liable for any disruption or loss you may suffer as a result. In the event
    of an outage, you may not be able to retrieve Your Content or Data that
    you’ve stored. We recommend that you regularly backup Your Content and Data
    that you store on the Services or store using Third-Party Apps and Services.
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Updates to the Services or Software, and Changes to These Terms</h2>
<p>
  7.
  <strong
    >Updates to the Services or Software, and Changes to These Terms.</strong
  >
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    a. We may change these Terms at any time, and we’ll tell you when we do.
    Using the Services after the changes become effective means you agree to the
    new terms. If you don’t agree to the new terms, you must stop using the
    Services, close your Microsoft account and, if you are a parent or guardian,
    help your minor child close his or her Microsoft account.
  </li>
  <li>
    b. Sometimes you’ll need software updates to keep using the Services. We may
    automatically check your version of the software and download software
    updates or configuration changes. You may also be required to update the
    software to continue using the Services. Such updates are subject to these
    Terms unless other terms accompany the updates, in which case, those other
    terms apply. Microsoft isn’t obligated to make any updates available and we
    don’t guarantee that we will support the version of the system or device for
    which you purchased or licensed the software, apps, content or other
    products.
  </li>
  <li>
    c. Additionally, there may be times when we need to remove or change
    features or functionality of the Service or stop providing a Service or
    access to Third-Party Apps and Services altogether. Except to the extent
    required by applicable law, we have no obligation to provide a re-download
    or replacement of any material, Digital Goods (defined in section 14.j), or
    applications previously purchased. We may release the Services or their
    features in a preview or beta version, which may not work correctly or in
    the same way the final version may work.
  </li>
  <li>
    d. So that you can use material protected with digital rights management
    (DRM), like some music, games, movies, books and more, DRM software may
    automatically contact an online rights server and download and install DRM
    updates.
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Software License</h2>
<p>
  8. <strong>Software License.</strong> Unless accompanied by a separate
  Microsoft license agreement (for example, if you are using a Microsoft
  application that is included with and a part of Windows, then the Microsoft
  Software License Terms for the Windows Operating System govern such software),
  any software provided by us to you as part of the Services is subject to these
  Terms. Applications acquired through certain Stores owned or operated by
  Microsoft or its affiliates (including, but not limited to the Office Store,
  Microsoft Store on Windows and Microsoft Store on Xbox) are subject to section
  14.b.i below.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    a. If you comply with these Terms, we grant you the right to install and use
    one copy of the software per device on a worldwide basis for use by only one
    person at a time as part of your use of the Services. For certain devices,
    such software may be pre-installed for your personal, non-commercial use of
    the Services. The software or website that is part of the Services may
    include third-party code. Any third-party scripts or code, linked to or
    referenced from the software or website, are licensed to you by the third
    parties that own such code, not by Microsoft. Notices, if any, for the
    third-party code are included for your information only.
  </li>
  <li>
    b. The software is licensed, not sold, and Microsoft reserves all rights to
    the software not expressly granted by Microsoft, whether by implication,
    estoppel, or otherwise. This license does not give you any right to, and you
    may not:
    <ul>
      <li>
        i. circumvent or bypass any technological protection measures in or
        relating to the software or Services;
      </li>
      <li>
        ii. disassemble, decompile, decrypt, hack, emulate, exploit, or reverse
        engineer any software or other aspect of the Services that is included
        in or accessible through the Services, except and only to the extent
        that the applicable copyright law expressly permits doing so;
      </li>
      <li>
        iii. separate components of the software or Services for use on
        different devices;
      </li>
      <li>
        iv. publish, copy, rent, lease, sell, export, import, distribute, or
        lend the software or the Services, unless Microsoft expressly authorizes
        you to do so;
      </li>
      <li>
        v. transfer the software, any software licenses, or any rights to access
        or use the Services;
      </li>
      <li>
        vi. use the Services in any unauthorized way that could interfere with
        anyone else’s use of them or gain access to any service, data, account,
        or network;
      </li>
      <li>
        vii. enable access to the Services or modify any Microsoft-authorized
        device (e.g., Xbox consoles, Microsoft Surface, etc.) by unauthorized
        third-party applications.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Payment Terms</h2>
<p>
  9. <strong>Payment Terms.</strong> If you purchase a Service, then these
  payment terms apply to your purchase and you agree to them.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    a. <strong>Charges.</strong> If there is a charge associated with a portion
    of the Services, you agree to pay that charge. The price stated for the
    Services excludes all applicable taxes and currency exchange settlements,
    unless stated otherwise. The price for Skype paid products includes a charge
    for the product and a charge for taxes. You are solely responsible for
    paying such taxes or other charges. Taxes are calculated based on your
    location at the time your Microsoft account was registered. We may suspend
    or cancel the Services if we do not receive an on time, full payment from
    you. Suspension or cancellation of the Services for non-payment could result
    in a loss of access to and use of your account and its content. Connecting
    to the Internet via a corporate or other private network that masks your
    location may cause charges to be different from those displayed for your
    actual location.
  </li>
  <li>
    b. <strong>Your Billing Account.</strong> To pay the charges for a Service,
    you will be asked to provide a payment method at the time you sign up for
    that Service. You can access and change your billing information and payment
    method on the
    <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=618281" target="_blank"
      >Microsoft account management website</a
    >
    (https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=618281) and for Skype by signing
    into your account portal at
    <a href="https://skype.com/go/myaccount" target="_blank"
      >https://skype.com/go/myaccount</a
    >. Additionally, you agree to permit Microsoft to use any updated account
    information regarding your selected payment method provided by your issuing
    bank or the applicable payment network. You agree to promptly update your
    account and other information, including your email address and payment
    method details, so we can complete your transactions and contact you as
    needed in connection with your transactions. Changes made to your billing
    account will not affect charges we submit to your billing account before we
    could reasonably act on your changes to your billing account.
  </li>
  <li>
    c. <strong>Billing.</strong> By providing Microsoft with a payment method,
    you (i) represent that you are authorized to use the payment method you
    provided and that any payment information you provide is true and accurate;
    (ii) authorize Microsoft to charge you for the Services or available content
    using your payment method; and (iii) authorize Microsoft to charge you for
    any paid feature of the Services you choose to sign up for or use while
    these Terms are in force. We may bill you (a) in advance; (b) at the time of
    purchase; (c) shortly after purchase; or (d) on a recurring basis for
    subscription Services. Also, we may charge you up to the amount you have
    approved, and we will notify you in advance of any change in the amount to
    be charged for recurring subscription Services. We may bill you at the same
    time for more than one of your prior billing periods for amounts that
    haven't previously been processed.
  </li>
  <li>
    d. <strong>Recurring Payments.</strong> When you purchase the Services on a
    subscription basis (e.g., monthly, every 3 months or annually), you agree
    that you are authorizing recurring payments, and payments will be made to
    Microsoft by the method and at the recurring intervals you have agreed to,
    until the subscription for that Service is terminated by you or by
    Microsoft. You must cancel your Services before the next billing date to
    stop being charged to continue your Services. We will provide you with
    instructions on how you may cancel the Services. By authorizing recurring
    payments, you are authorizing Microsoft to store your payment instrument and
    process such payments as either electronic debits or fund transfers, or as
    electronic drafts from your designated account (for Automated Clearing House
    or similar payments), or as charges to your designated account (for credit
    card or similar payments) (collectively,
    <strong>"Electronic Payments"</strong>). Subscription fees are generally
    charged in advance of the applicable subscription period. If any payment is
    returned unpaid or if any credit card or similar transaction is rejected or
    denied, Microsoft or its service providers reserve the right to collect any
    applicable return item, rejection or insufficient funds fee and process any
    such payment as an Electronic Payment.
  </li>
  <li>
    e. <strong>Online Statement and Errors.</strong> Microsoft will provide you
    with an online billing statement on the
    <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=618282" target="_blank"
      >Microsoft account management website</a
    >
    (https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=618282), where you can view and
    print your statement. For Skype, you can access your online statement by
    signing into your account at
    <a href="https://www.skype.com/" target="_blank">www.skype.com</a>
    (https://www.skype.com). This is the only billing statement that we provide.
    If we make an error on your bill, you must tell us within 90 days after the
    error first appears on your bill. We will then promptly investigate the
    charge. If you do not tell us within that time, you release us from all
    liability and claims of loss resulting from the error and we won't be
    required to correct the error or provide a refund. If Microsoft has
    identified a billing error, we will correct that error within 90 days.
  </li>
  <li>
    f. <strong>Refund Policy.</strong> Unless otherwise provided by law or by a
    particular Service offer, all purchases are final and non-refundable. If you
    believe that Microsoft has charged you in error, you must contact us within
    90 days of such charge. No refunds will be given for any charges more than
    90 days old. We reserve the right to issue refunds or credits at our sole
    discretion. If we issue a refund or credit, we are under no obligation to
    issue the same or similar refund in the future. This refund policy does not
    affect any statutory rights that may apply. For more refund information,
    please visit our
    <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=618283" target="_blank"
      >help topic</a
    >
    (https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=618283).
  </li>
  <li>
    g. <strong>Canceling the Services.</strong> You may cancel a Service at any
    time, with or without cause. Cancelling paid Services stops future charges
    to continue the Service. To cancel a Service and request a refund, if you
    are entitled to one, visit the Microsoft account management website. You can
    request a refund from Skype using the
    <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=618286" target="_blank"
      >Cancellation and Refund form</a
    >
    (https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=618286). You should refer back to
    the offer describing the Services as (i) you may not receive a refund at the
    time of cancellation; (ii) you may be obligated to pay cancellation charges;
    (iii) you may be obligated to pay all charges made to your billing account
    for the Services before the date of cancellation; and (iv) you may lose
    access to and use of your account when you cancel the Services. We will
    process your Data as described above in section 4. If you cancel, your
    access to the Services ends at the end of your current Service period or, if
    we bill your account on a periodic basis, at the end of the period in which
    you canceled. If you initiate a chargeback or reversal with your bank for
    your payment of Services, we will deem you to have canceled as of the date
    that the original payment was made, and you authorize us to immediately
    cancel your service and/or revoke any content that was provided to you in
    exchange for such payment.
  </li>
  <li>
    h. <strong>Trial-Period Offers.</strong> If you are taking part in any
    trial-period offer, you may be required to cancel the trial Service(s)
    within the timeframe communicated to you when you accepted the offer in
    order to avoid being charged to continue the Service(s) at the end of the
    trial period.
  </li>
  <li>
    i. <strong>Promotional Offers.</strong> From time to time, Microsoft may
    offer Services for a trial period during which Microsoft will not charge you
    for the Services. Microsoft reserves the right to charge you for such
    Services (at the normal rate) if Microsoft determines (in its reasonable
    discretion) that you are breaching the terms and conditions of the offer.
  </li>
  <li>
    j. <strong>Price Changes.</strong> We may change the price of the Services
    at any time and if you have a recurring purchase, we will notify you by
    email, or other reasonable manner, at least 15 days before the price change.
    If you do not agree to the price change, you must cancel and stop using the
    Services before the price change takes effect. If there is a fixed term and
    price for your Service offer, that price will remain in force for the fixed
    term.
  </li>
  <li>
    k. <strong>Payments to You.</strong> If we owe you a payment, then you agree
    to timely and accurately provide us with any information we need to get that
    payment to you. You are responsible for any taxes and charges you may incur
    as a result of this payment to you. You must also comply with any other
    conditions we place on your right to any payment. If you receive a payment
    in error, we may reverse or require return of the payment. You agree to
    cooperate with us in our efforts to do this. We may reduce the payment to
    you without notice to adjust for any previous overpayment.
  </li>
  <li>
    l. <strong>Gift Cards.</strong> Redemption and use of gift cards (other than
    Skype gift cards) are governed by the
    <a
      href="https://support.microsoft.com/help/10562/microsoft-account-gift-card-terms-and-conditions"
      target="_blank"
      >Microsoft Gift Card Terms and Conditions</a
    >
    (https://support.microsoft.com/help/10562/microsoft-account-gift-card-terms-and-conditions).
    Information on Skype gift cards is available on
    <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=615383" target="_blank"
      >Skype’s Help page</a
    >
    (https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=615383).
  </li>
  <li>
    m. <strong>Bank Account Payment Method.</strong> You may register an
    eligible bank account with your Microsoft account to use it as a payment
    method. Eligible bank accounts include accounts held at a financial
    institution capable of receiving direct debit entries (e.g., a United
    States-based financial institution that supports automated clearing house
    ("<strong>ACH</strong>") entries, a European financial institution that
    supports Single Euro Payments Area ("<strong>SEPA</strong>") or "iDEAL" in
    the Netherlands). Terms you agreed to when adding your bank account as a
    payment method in your Microsoft account (e.g., the “mandate” in the case of
    SEPA) also apply. You represent and warrant that your registered bank
    account is held in your name or you are authorized to register and use this
    bank account as a payment method. By registering or selecting your bank
    account as your payment method, you authorize Microsoft (or its agent) to
    initiate one or more debits for the total amount of your purchase or
    subscription charge (in accordance with the terms of your subscription
    service) from your bank account (and, if necessary, initiate one or more
    credits to your bank account to correct errors, issue a refund or similar
    purpose), and you authorize the financial institution that holds your bank
    account to deduct such debits or accept such credits. You understand that
    this authorization will remain in full force and effect until you remove
    your bank account information from your Microsoft account. Contact customer
    support as outlined above in section 4.e as soon as possible if you believe
    you have been charged in error. Laws applicable in your country may also
    limit your liability for any fraudulent, erroneous or unauthorized
    transactions from your bank account. By registering or selecting a bank
    account as your payment method, you acknowledge that you have read,
    understand and agree to these Terms.
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Contracting Entity, Choice of Law, Jurisdiction</h2>
<p>
  10. <strong>Contracting Entity.</strong> For use of free and paid consumer
  Skype-branded Services, you're contracting with, and all references to
  “Microsoft” in these Terms mean, Skype Communications S.à.r.l, 23 – 29 Rives
  de Clausen, L-2165 Luxembourg. For all other Services, you're contracting with
  Microsoft Corporation, One Microsoft Way, Redmond, WA 98052, U.S.A.
</p>
<p>
  11. <strong>Choice of Law and Place to Resolve Disputes.</strong> If you live
  in (or, if a business, your principal place of business is in) the United
  States, the laws of the state where you live (or, if a business, where your
  principal place of business is located) govern all claims, regardless of
  conflict of laws principles, except that the Federal Arbitration Act governs
  all provisions relating to arbitration. You and we irrevocably consent to the
  exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the state or federal courts in King
  County, Washington, for all disputes arising out of or relating to these Terms
  or the Services that are not heard in arbitration or small claims court.
</p>
<h2>Warranties</h2>
<p>
  12.<strong>
    Warranties. MICROSOFT, AND OUR AFFILIATES, RESELLERS, DISTRIBUTORS, AND
    VENDORS, MAKE NO WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, GUARANTEES OR CONDITIONS
    WITH RESPECT TO YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT USE OF THE
    SERVICES IS AT YOUR OWN RISK AND THAT WE PROVIDE THE SERVICES ON AN "AS IS"
    BASIS "WITH ALL FAULTS" AND "AS AVAILABLE." YOU BEAR THE ENTIRE RISK OF
    USING THE SERVICES. MICROSOFT DOESN'T GUARANTEE THE ACCURACY OR TIMELINESS
    OF THE SERVICES. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER YOUR LOCAL LAW, WE EXCLUDE
    ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING FOR MERCHANTABILITY, SATISFACTORY QUALITY,
    FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, WORKMANLIKE EFFORT, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.
    YOU MAY HAVE CERTAIN RIGHTS UNDER YOUR LOCAL LAW. NOTHING IN THESE TERMS IS
    INTENDED TO AFFECT THOSE RIGHTS, IF THEY ARE APPLICABLE. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE
    THAT COMPUTER AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS ARE NOT FAULT-FREE AND
    OCCASIONAL PERIODS OF DOWNTIME OCCUR. WE DO NOT GUARANTEE THE SERVICES WILL
    BE UNINTERRUPTED, TIMELY, SECURE, OR ERROR-FREE OR THAT CONTENT LOSS WON'T
    OCCUR, NOR DO WE GUARANTEE ANY CONNECTION TO OR TRANSMISSION FROM THE
    COMPUTER NETWORKS.</strong

</p>
<h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
<p>
  13.
  <strong
    >Limitation of Liability. If you have any basis for recovering damages
    (including breach of these Terms), you agree that your exclusive remedy is
    to recover, from Microsoft or any affiliates, resellers, distributors,
    Third-Party Apps and Services providers, and vendors, direct damages up to
    an amount equal to your Services fee for the month during which the loss or
    breach occurred (or up to $10.00 if the Services are free). You can't
    recover any other damages or losses, including direct, consequential, lost
    profits, special, indirect, incidental, or punitive.</strong
  >
  These limitations and exclusions apply even if this remedy doesn't fully
  compensate you for any losses or fails of its essential purpose or if we knew
  or should have known about the possibility of the damages. To the maximum
  extent permitted by law, these limitations and exclusions apply to anything or
  any claims related to these Terms, the Services, or the software related to
  the Services.
</p>
<h2>Service-Specific Terms</h2>
<p>
  14. <strong>Service-Specific Terms.</strong> The terms before and after
  section 14 apply generally to all Services. This section contains
  service-specific terms that are in addition to the general terms. These
  service-specific terms govern if there are any conflicts with the general
  terms.
</p>
<h2>Xbox</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    a. <strong>Xbox.</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>
        i. <strong>Personal Noncommercial Use.</strong> The Xbox online service,
        <a href="https://www.xbox.com/xbox-game-studios" target="_blank"
          >Xbox Game Studios games</a
        >
        (including Mojang Games) (https://www.xbox.com/xbox-game-studios),
        applications, subscriptions (e.g., Xbox Game Pass subscription service
        offerings), services (e.g., Xbox Cloud Gaming), and content provided by
        Microsoft (collectively, the "<strong>Xbox Services</strong>") are only
        for your personal and noncommercial use.
      </li>
      <li>
        ii. <strong>Xbox Services.</strong> When you sign up to receive Xbox
        Services, information about your game play, activities and usage of
        games and Xbox Services will be tracked and shared with applicable
        third-parties, including game developers and publishers, in order for
        Microsoft to deliver the Xbox Services and for the third-parties to
        operate non-Microsoft games and services. Additionally, if Xbox Services
        are accessed via third-party platforms, information about your game
        play, activities and usage of games and Xbox Services may be tracked and
        shared by such third-party platforms, subject to any third-party terms
        and privacy policies. If you choose to link your Microsoft Xbox Services
        account with your account on a non-Microsoft service or sign in to your
        Xbox Services account to access a non-Microsoft Service (for example, a
        non-Microsoft game publisher of Third-Party Apps and Services), you
        agree that: (a) Microsoft may share limited account and usage-related
        information (including without limitation gamertag, gamerscore, game
        history, usage data and friends list), with that non-Microsoft party as
        stated in the Microsoft Privacy Statement, and (b) if allowed by your
        Xbox privacy settings, the non-Microsoft party may also have access to
        Your Content from in-game communications or other applications that you
        use when you are signed into your account with that non-Microsoft party.
        Also, if allowed by your Xbox privacy settings, Microsoft can publish
        your name, gamertag, gamerpic, motto, avatar, gameclips and games that
        you’ve played in communications to people you allow.
      </li>
      <li>
        iii. <strong>Your Content.</strong> As part of building the Xbox
        Services community, you grant to Microsoft, its affiliates and
        sublicensees a free and worldwide right to use, modify, reproduce,

        v. <strong>Kids on Xbox.</strong> If you are a minor using the Xbox
        Services, your parent or guardian may have control over many aspects of
        your account on the Xbox platform and may receive reports about your use
        of the Xbox Services. These features are exclusive to Xbox Services and

        limited, personal, revocable, non-transferable, non-sublicensable
        license to use the game currency and virtual goods in the Xbox Services
        only, you have no right or title in or to any such game currency or
        virtual goods appearing or originating in the Xbox Services, or any
        other attributes associated with use of the Services or stored within

        discretion.
      </li>
      <li>
        vii. <strong>Software Updates.</strong> For any device that can connect
        to Xbox Services, we may automatically check your version of Xbox
        console software or the Xbox app software and download Xbox console or
        Xbox app software updates or configuration changes, including those that
        prevent you from accessing the Xbox Services, using unauthorized Xbox
        games or Xbox apps, or using unauthorized hardware peripheral devices
        with an Xbox console.
      </li>
      <li>
        viii. <strong>Cheating and Tampering Software.</strong> For any device
        that can connect to Xbox Services, we may automatically check your
        device for unauthorized hardware or software that enables cheating or

<h2>Store</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    b. <strong>Store.</strong> "Store" refers to a Service that allows you to
    browse, download, purchase, and rate and review applications (the term
    "application" includes games) and other digital content. These Terms cover
    use of certain Stores owned or operated by Microsoft or its affiliates
    (including, but not limited to, the Office Store, Microsoft Store on Xbox
    and Microsoft Store on Windows). <strong>"Office Store"</strong> means a
    Store for Office products and apps for Office, Microsoft 365, SharePoint,
    Exchange, Access and Project (2013 versions or later), or any other
    experience that is branded Office Store.
    <strong>"Microsoft Store on Windows"</strong> means a Store, owned and
    operated by Microsoft or its affiliates, for Windows devices such as phone,
    PC and tablet, or any other experience that is branded Microsoft Store and
    accessible on Windows devices such as phone, PC, or tablet.
    <strong>"Microsoft Store on Xbox"</strong> means a Store owned and operated
    by Microsoft or its affiliates and made available on Xbox consoles, or any
    other experience that is branded Microsoft Store and made available on an
    Xbox console.
    <ul>
      <li>
        i. <strong>License Terms.</strong> We will identify the publisher of
        each application available in the relevant Store. Unless different
        license terms are provided with the application, the Standard
        Application License Terms (<strong>"SALT"</strong>) at the end of these
        Terms are an agreement between you and the application publisher setting
        forth the license terms that apply to an application you download
        through any Store owned or operated by Microsoft or its affiliates
        (excluding the Office Store). For clarity, these Terms cover the use of,
        and services provided by, Microsoft Services. Section 5 of these Terms
        also applies to any Third-Party Apps and Services acquired through a
        Store. Applications downloaded through the Office Store are not governed
        by the SALT and have separate license terms that apply.
      </li>
      <li>
        ii. <strong>Updates.</strong> Microsoft will automatically check for and
        download updates to your applications, even if you’re not signed into
        the relevant Store. You can change your Store or system settings if you
        prefer not to receive automatic updates to Store applications. However,
        certain Office Store applications that are entirely or partly hosted
        online may be updated at any time by the application developer and may
        not require your permission to update.
      </li>
      <li>
        iii. <strong>Ratings and Reviews.</strong> If you rate or review an
        application or other Digital Good in the Store, you may receive email
        from Microsoft containing content from the publisher of the application
        or Digital Good. Any such email comes from Microsoft; we do not share
        your email address with publishers of applications or other Digital
        Goods you acquire through the Store.
      </li>
      <li>
        iv. <strong>Safety Warning.</strong> To avoid possible injury,
        discomfort or eye strain, you should take periodic breaks from use of
        games or other applications, especially if you feel any pain or fatigue
        resulting from usage. If you experience discomfort, take a break.
        Discomfort might include feelings of nausea, motion sickness, dizziness,
        disorientation, headache, fatigue, eye strain, or dry eyes. Using
        applications can distract you and obstruct your surroundings. Avoid trip
        hazards, stairs, low ceilings, fragile or valuable items that could be
        damaged. A very small percentage of people may experience seizures when
        exposed to certain visual images like flashing lights or patterns that
        may appear in applications. Even people with no history of seizures may
        have an undiagnosed condition that can cause these seizures. Symptoms
        may include lightheadedness, altered vision, twitching, jerking or
        shaking of limbs, disorientation, confusion, loss of consciousness, or
        convulsions. Immediately stop using and consult a doctor if you
        experience any of these symptoms, or consult a doctor before using the
        applications if you’ve ever suffered symptoms linked to seizures.
        Parents should monitor their children’s use of applications for signs of
        symptoms.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Microsoft Family Features</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    c. <strong>Microsoft Family Features.</strong> Parents and kids can use
    Microsoft family features, including Microsoft Family Safety, to build trust
    based on a shared understanding of what behaviors, websites, apps, games,
    physical locations, and spending is right in their family. Parents can
    create a family by going to
    <a href="https://account.microsoft.com/family" target="_blank"
      >https://account.microsoft.com/family</a
    >
    (or by following the instructions on their Windows device or Xbox console)
    and inviting kids or other parents to join. There are many features
    available to family members, so please carefully review the information
    provided when you agree to create or join a family and when you purchase
    Digital Goods for family access. By creating or joining a family, you agree
    to use the family in accordance with its purpose and won’t use it in an
    unauthorized way to unlawfully gain access to another person’s information.
    Microsoft Family Features are exclusive to Microsoft Services and are not
    transferable to other platforms. For example, Xbox-specific Family Safety
    settings will apply on Xbox console or via Xbox on PC or Mobile device but
    may not apply on other platforms.
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Group Messaging</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    d.
    <strong>Group Messaging.</strong>
    Various Microsoft services allow you to send messages to others via voice or
    SMS ("messages"), and/or allow Microsoft and Microsoft-controlled affiliates
    to send such messages to you and one or more other users on your behalf.
    WHEN YOU INSTRUCT MICROSOFT AND MICROSOFT-CONTROLLED AFFILIATES TO SEND SUCH
    MESSAGES TO YOU OR TO OTHERS, YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT TO US THAT YOU AND
    EACH PERSON YOU HAVE INSTRUCTED US TO MESSAGE CONSENT TO RECEIVE SUCH
    MESSAGES AND ANY OTHER RELATED ADMINISTRATIVE TEXT MESSAGES FROM MICROSOFT
    AND MICROSOFT-CONTROLLED AFFILIATES. "Administrative text messages" are
    periodic transactional messages from a particular Microsoft service,
    including but not limited to a "welcome message" or instructions on how to
    stop receiving messages. You or group members no longer wishing to receive
    such messages can opt-out of receiving further messages from Microsoft or
    Microsoft-controlled affiliates at any time by following the instructions
    provided. If you no longer wish to receive such messages or participate in
    the group, you agree that you will opt out through the instructions provided
    by the applicable program or service. If you have reason to believe that a
    group member no longer wishes to receive such messages or participate in the
    group, you agree to remove them from the group. You also represent and
    warrant to us that you and each person you have instructed us to message
    understands that each group member is responsible for the costs of any
    message charges assessed by his or her mobile carrier, including any
    international message charges that may apply when messages are transmitted
    from US-based numbers.
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Skype, Microsoft Teams, and GroupMe</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    e. <strong>Skype, Microsoft Teams, and GroupMe.</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>
        i. <strong>Emergency Services.</strong> There are important differences
        between traditional mobile or fixed line telephone services and Skype,
        Microsoft Teams, and GroupMe. Microsoft has limited obligations under
        applicable local or national rules, regulations or law to offer access
        to emergency services, such as 911 or 112 emergency calling (“Emergency
        Services”), through Skype, Microsoft Teams, and GroupMe.
      </li>
      <li>
        ii. Only limited software versions of the Skype to Phone feature of
        Skype may support calls to Emergency Services in a very limited number
        of countries, and depending on the platform used. You can find details
        about availability and how to configure this feature here:
        https://www.skype.com/go/emergency. If your Skype to Phone emergency
        call is connected, you will need to provide the details of your physical
        location to enable the emergency services to respond to you.
      </li>
      <li>
        iii. <strong>APIs or Broadcasting.</strong> If you want to use Skype in
        connection with any broadcast, you must comply with the "Broadcast TOS"
        at
        <a href="https://www.skype.com/go/legal.broadcast" target="_blank"
          >https://www.skype.com/go/legal.broadcast</a
        >. If you want to use any application program interface
        (<strong>"API"</strong>) exposed or made available by Skype you must
        comply with the applicable licensing terms, which are available at
        <a href="https://www.skype.com/go/legal" target="_blank"
          >www.skype.com/go/legal</a
        >.
      </li>
      <li>
        iv. <strong>Fair Use Policies.</strong> Fair usage policies may apply to
        your use of Skype. Please review these policies which are designed to
        protect against fraud and abuse and may place limits on the type,
        duration or volume of calls or messages that you are able to make. These
        policies are incorporated in these Terms by reference. You can find
        these policies at:
        <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=615381" target="_blank"
          >https://www.skype.com/en/legal/fair-usage/</a
        >.
      </li>
      <li>
        v. <strong>Mapping.</strong> Skype contains features that allow you to
        submit information to, or plot yourself on a map using, a mapping
        service. By using those features, you agree to these Terms and the
        Google Maps terms available at
        <a
          href="https://www.google.com/intl/en_ALL/help/terms_maps.html"
          target="_blank"

        >.
      </li>
      <li>
        vi. <strong>Personal/Noncommercial Use.</strong> The use of Skype is for
        your personal and noncommercial use. You are permitted to use Skype at
        work for your own business communications.
      </li>
      <li>
        vii. <strong>Skype Number/Skype To Go.</strong> If Skype provides you
        with a Skype Number or Skype To Go number, you agree that you do not own
        the number or have a right to retain that number forever. For more
        details on Skype Number see
        <a href="https://secure.skype.com/en/skype-number/" target="_blank"

        >.
      </li>
      <li>
        viii. <strong>Skype Manager.</strong> A "Skype Manager Admin Account" is
        created and managed by you, acting as an individual administrator of a
        Skype Manager group and not as a business entity. You may link your
        individual Microsoft account to a Skype Manager group (<strong
          >"Linked Account"</strong
        >). You may appoint additional administrators to your Skype Manager
        group subject to their acceptance of these Terms. If you allocate Skype
        Numbers to a Linked Account, you are responsible for compliance with any
        requirements related to the residency or location of your Linked Account
        users. If you choose to unlink a Linked Account from a Skype Manager
        group, any allocated subscriptions, Skype Credit or Skype Numbers will
        not be retrievable and Your Content or material associated with the
        unlinked account will no longer be accessible by you. You agree to
        process any personal information of your Linked Account users in
        accordance with all applicable data protection laws.
      </li>
      <li>
        ix. <strong>Skype Charges.</strong> Skype paid products are sold to you
        by Skype Communications S.à.r.l, however the seller-of-record
        accountable for taxes is Skype Communications US Corporation. Taxes
        means the amount of taxes, regulatory fees, surcharges or other fees
        that we are required to collect from you and must pay to any United
        States (federal, state or local) or foreign government, agency,
        commission or quasi-governmental body as a result of our provision of
        Skype paid products to you. These taxes are listed at
        <a href="https://www.skype.com/go/ustax" target="_blank"
          >www.skype.com/go/ustax</a
        >. All prices for Skype paid products are inclusive of a charge for your
        product and a charge for taxes, unless otherwise stated. The charges
        payable for calling phones outside of a subscription consist of a
        connection fee (charged once per call) and a per-minute rate as set out
        at
        <a href="https://www.skype.com/go/allrates" target="_blank"
          >www.skype.com/go/allrates</a
        >. Call charges will be deducted from your Skype Credit balance. Skype
        may change its calling rates at any time by posting such change at
        <a href="https://www.skype.com/go/allrates" target="_blank"
          >www.skype.com/go/allrates</a
        >. The new rate will apply to your next call after publication of the
        new rates. Please check the latest rates before you make your call.
        Fractional call minutes and fractional cent charges will be rounded up
        to the next whole unit. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you may be
        entitled, under applicable law, to a refund, upon request, of any
        pre-paid subscription balance in the event you switch your Skype Number
        to another provider.
      </li>
      <li>
        x. <strong>Skype Credit.</strong> Skype does not guarantee that you will
        be able to use your Skype Credit balance to purchase all Skype paid
        products. If you do not use your Skype Credit for a period of 180 days,
        Skype will place your Skype Credit on inactive status. You can
        reactivate the Skype Credit by following the reactivation link at
        <a
          href="https://www.skype.com/go/store.reactivate.credit"
          target="_blank"
          >https://www.skype.com/go/store.reactivate.credit</a
        >. You can enable the Auto Recharge feature when you buy Skype Credit by
        ticking the appropriate box. If enabled, your Skype Credit balance will
        be recharged with the same amount and by your chosen payment method
        every time your Skype balance goes below the threshold set by Skype from
        time to time. If you purchased a subscription with a payment method
        other than credit card, PayPal or Moneybookers (Skrill), and you have
        enabled Auto-Recharge, your Skype Credit balance will be recharged with
        the amount necessary to purchase your next recurring subscription. You
        can disable Auto-Recharge at any time by accessing and changing your
        settings in your account portal in Skype. If your Microsoft Account is
        closed, for any reason, any unused Skype credit associated with your
        Microsoft account will be lost and cannot be retrieved.
      </li>
      <li>
        xi. <strong>International Message Fees.</strong> GroupMe currently uses
        US-based numbers for each group created. Every text message sent to or
        received from a GroupMe number will count as an international text
        message sent to or received from the United States. Depending upon your
        location, Microsoft Teams may be using a phone number that could count
        as an international text message. Please check with your provider for
        the associated international rates.

<h2>Microsoft Rewards</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    m. <strong>Microsoft Rewards.</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>
        i. <strong>General Information.</strong> Microsoft Rewards (the "<strong
          >Rewards Program</strong
        >") is free to join, and it enables you to earn points
        ("<strong>Points</strong>") for certain activities and for personal use
        of certain Microsoft products and services. If you have a Microsoft
        account and are located in a participating Region (defined below), you
        have been automatically enrolled in the Rewards Program and can begin
        earning Points immediately. You can cancel your participation in the
        Rewards Program at any time by following the instructions below.
      </li>
      <li>
        ii. You can redeem your Points in a variety of ways ("<strong
          >Redemption Options</strong
        >"), including for certain products and services listed on the
        <a href="https://aka.ms/redeemrewards" target="_blank"
          >Redemption Page</a
        >

          >https://aka.ms/redeemrewards</a
        >
        ("<strong>Rewards</strong>"). To be eligible to redeem your Points for
        any Redemption Option, you must first activate your Rewards Program
        account ("<strong>Rewards Account</strong>") on the
        <a href="https://rewards.microsoft.com/" target="_blank"
          >Rewards Dashboard</a
        >

        <a href="https://rewards.microsoft.com/" target="_blank"
          >https://rewards.microsoft.com/</a
        >
        or on certain other Microsoft sites and pages. There is no cost to
        activate your Rewards Account.
      </li>
      <li>
        iii. Certain restrictions and limitations apply to earning, redeeming,
        and other uses of Points in the Rewards Program. For more information
        see the Rewards section at
        <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/" target="_blank"
          >https://support.microsoft.com</a
        >
        ("<strong>FAQ</strong>").
      </li>
      <li>
        iv. <strong>Requirements.</strong> You need a valid Microsoft account
        and you must reside in one of the geographic areas listed in the FAQ
        ("<strong>Regions</strong>") to activate your Rewards Account and to
        earn, redeem, or otherwise use Points. You may open and use only one
        Rewards Account, even if you have multiple email addresses. Each
        household is limited to six Rewards Accounts. The Rewards Program is
        solely for your personal and noncommercial use. Use of a virtual private
        network (VPN) or other technology or service that can be used to mask or
        obfuscate your geographic location may result in cancellation of your
        Rewards Account and forfeiture of your accrued Points.
      </li>
      <li>
        v. <strong>Earning Points.</strong> You may be presented with
        opportunities to earn Points for certain qualifying activities
        ("<strong>Offers</strong>"), such as Searches, Acquisitions, use of
        certain Microsoft products and services, and other opportunities from
        Microsoft. You must have an active Rewards Account to take advantage of
        such Offers. After completing requirements for certain Offers, you may
        be required to claim the Points on the Rewards Dashboard before the
        Points are earned and added to your Rewards Account. Failure to claim
        the Points within the time specified by Microsoft may result in the
        Points being forfeited. Eligible Offers may vary by Region and may only
        be available for a certain time or subject to other limitations. You
        must comply with all terms and conditions of a particular Offer to earn
        Points awarded with that Offer. You may be presented with Offers
        directly on the Rewards Dashboard or when you use certain Microsoft
        products and services. From time to time, Microsoft may offer or award
        you additional Points in its sole discretion and with or without prior
        notice, including for what Microsoft determines to be good-faith
        Searches and other interactions with Microsoft services.
      </li>
      <li>
        vi. For purposes of the Rewards Program, a "<strong>Search</strong>" is
        the act of an individual user manually entering text for the good faith
        purpose of obtaining Bing search results for such user’s own research
        purposes; a “Search” does not include queries not intended or used for
        genuine good-faith personal research purposes or a query entered by a
        bot, macro, or other automated or fraudulent means of any kind. For
        purposes of the Rewards Program, an “<strong>Acquisition</strong>” is
        the process of purchasing goods or downloading and acquiring a license
        for digital content directly from Microsoft, whether free or paid.
        Points are not offered for every Acquisition from Microsoft, and certain
        restrictions may apply.
      </li>
      <li>
        vii. <strong>Restrictions &amp; Limitations on Points.</strong> Points
        are awarded by Microsoft to individual Rewards Accounts and cannot be
        transferred to any other person or entity. Notwithstanding the
        foregoing, Microsoft may from time to time in its sole discretion permit
        you (i) to share your Points within your household (limits may apply),
        (ii) to contribute your Points to support a nonprofit organization
        listed on the Redemption Page, or (iii) depending on your Region and
        subject to other terms and conditions, to redeem all or some of your
        Points for points in certain other rewards or loyalty programs,
        including programs operated by Microsoft or authorized third parties.
        Points are and remain at all times the property of Microsoft, and do not
        constitute your personal property; they have no cash value, and you may
        not obtain any cash or money in exchange for them. Points are awarded to
        you on a promotional basis only. You cannot purchase Points. Microsoft
        may limit the quantity of Points or Rewards that can be earned or
        redeemed per person, per household, or over a set period (e.g., a day)
        provided that you are not disadvantaged in breach of good faith; please
        refer to the FAQ for currently applicable limitations. Unless an Offer
        or Redemption Option explicitly states otherwise, Points earned in the
        Program are not valid in, and may not be used in combination with, any
        other program offered by Microsoft or third parties.
        <strong
          >Unredeemed Points associated with your Rewards Account expire if you
          do not earn or redeem any Points in your Rewards Account for 18
          consecutive months.</strong
        >
      </li>
      <li>
        viii. <strong>Redemptions.</strong> Redemption Options will be made
        available to you on the Redemption Page and on certain other Microsoft
        sites and pages. You must earn and have available in your Rewards
        Account all of the Points required for a Redemption Option before you
        can redeem your Points for that Redemption Option. There may be a
        limited number of a particular Reward available, and those Rewards will
        be delivered on a first-come, first-served basis. You may be required to
        provide additional information, like your mailing address and a
        telephone number (other than a VOIP or toll-free number), and you may
        also be asked to enter a fraud-prevention code or sign additional legal
        documents to redeem Points for certain Redemption Options. Once you
        redeem your Points, you cannot cancel or return the Redemption Option
        for a refund of Points except in the case of defective products or as
        required by applicable law. If you select a Redemption Option that is
        out of stock or unavailable for other reasons, we may substitute a
        Redemption Option of comparable value or refund your points at our sole
        discretion.
      </li>
      <li>
        ix. Microsoft may update or discontinue offering specific Redemption
        Options at any time for any reason. Some Redemption Options may have age
        or Region eligibility requirements, or other terms or conditions on
        their redemption or use. Any such requirements or conditions will be
        included in the relevant redemption offer. You are responsible for all
        federal, state, and local taxes and any other costs of accepting and
        using the Redemption Option. Rewards will be emailed to the email
        address associated with your Microsoft account, so keep your email
        address up to date. Rewards that are undeliverable will not be reissued
        and are therefore forfeited. Rewards may not be resold. You may redeem
        no more than 550,000 Points per calendar year in the Rewards Program.
      </li>
      <li>
        x. <strong>Cancelling Your Rewards Account.</strong> If you no longer
        wish to participate in the Rewards Program, follow the instructions on
        the
        <a
          href="https://account.microsoft.com/rewards/optout?confirm=false"
          target="_blank"
          >opt out page</a
        >
        (https://account.microsoft.com/rewards/optout?confirm=false) to cancel
        your Rewards Account. If you cancel your Rewards Account, you will
        immediately forfeit all of your earned Points and will lose your ability
        to earn new Points in the future. To begin earning Points again, you
        must open a new Rewards Account (but Microsoft will not reinstate any
        previously forfeited Points).
        <strong
          >Your Rewards Account may be cancelled (and your Points forfeited) if
          you do not log in to your Microsoft account for 18 consecutive
          months.</strong
        >
      </li>
      <li>
        xi. <strong>Program Changes or Discontinuation.</strong> Microsoft
        reserves the right to change, modify, discontinue, or cancel the Rewards
        Program or any part thereof at any time, in its sole discretion, and
        without prior notice. However, if the Rewards Program is cancelled or
        discontinued, we will make reasonable efforts to notify you by email and
        on the Rewards Dashboard and to provide you with at least 90 days to
        redeem your accrued Points, unless we determine that such cancellation
        must take effect immediately for legal or security reasons.
      </li>
      <li>
        xii. <strong>Other Terms.</strong> Microsoft reserves the right to
        immediately cancel your Rewards Account, disqualify you from future
        participation in the Rewards Program, forfeit all of your earned Points,
        and cancel or suspend any Redemption Option you have obtained through
        the Rewards Program if Microsoft believes you have tampered with,
        abused, or defrauded any aspect of the Rewards Program or breached these
        terms. Microsoft further reserves the right to cancel or suspend any
        Redemption Option you have obtained or attempted to obtain through the
        Rewards Program if Microsoft determines you are ineligible to receive
        that Redemption Option for legal reasons (such as export laws). While
        Microsoft makes every effort to ensure accuracy, errors occasionally
        occur. Microsoft therefore reserves the right to correct such errors at
        any time, even if it affects current Offers or your pending, earned, or
        redeemed Points or Rewards. In the event of any inconsistency or
        discrepancy between these Rewards Program terms or other statements
        contained in any related materials or advertising, these terms prevail,
        govern, and control.

        receive from, the AI services (including feedback and suggestions).
        You'll need to make your own determination regarding the intellectual
        property rights you have in output content and its usability, taking
        into account, among other things, your usage scenario(s) and the laws of
        the relevant jurisdiction. You warrant and represent that you own or
        otherwise control all of the rights to your content as described in
        these Terms including, without limitation, all the rights necessary for
        you to provide, post, upload, input, or submit the content.
      </li>
      <li>
        vii. <strong>Content credentials.</strong> When you use AI to generate
        certain content with our AI services, Microsoft stores information about
        its creation and associates this information and the content with a
        content credential. You may not create content with the purpose of
        removing or altering content credentials or other provenance methods,
        marks or signals that indicate that an output was generated by the AI
        services or otherwise use the AI services to create content for the
        purpose of misleading others about whether an output was generated by
        the AI services.
      </li>
      <li>
        viii. <strong>Third-party claims.</strong> You are solely responsible
        for responding to any third-party claims regarding Your use of the AI
        services in compliance with applicable laws (including, but not limited
        to, copyright infringement or other claims relating to content output
        during Your use of the AI services).

<h2>Binding Arbitration and Class Action Waiver</h2>
<p>
  15.
  <strong
    >Binding Arbitration and Class Action Waiver If You Live In (or, If a
    Business, Your Principal Place of Business Is In) the United States.</strong
  >
  We hope we never have a dispute, but if we do, you and we agree to try for 60
  days, upon receipt of a Notice of Dispute, to resolve it informally. If we
  can’t, you and we agree to
  <strong
    >binding individual arbitration before the American Arbitration Association
    ("AAA") under the Federal Arbitration Act ("FAA"), and not to sue in court
    in front of a judge or jury</strong
  >. Instead, a neutral arbitrator will decide and the arbitrator’s decision
  will be final except for a limited right of review under the FAA.
  <strong
    >Class action lawsuits, class-wide arbitrations, private attorney-general
    actions, requests for public injunctions, and any other proceeding or
    request for relief where someone acts in a representative capacity aren’t
    allowed. Nor is combining individual proceedings without the consent of all
    parties. </strong
  >"We," "our," and "us" includes Microsoft and Microsoft’s affiliates.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    a. <strong>Disputes Covered—Everything Except IP.</strong> The term
    "dispute" is as broad as it can be. It includes any claim or controversy
    between you and us concerning the Services, the software related to the
    Services, the Services’ or software’s price, your Microsoft account,
    marketing, communications, your purchase transaction, billing, or these
    Terms, under any legal theory including contract, warranty, tort, statute,
    or regulation,
    <strong
      >except disputes relating to the enforcement or validity of your, your
      licensors’, our, or our licensors’ intellectual property rights</strong
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    b. <strong>Send a Notice of Dispute Before Arbitration.</strong> If you have
    a dispute that our customer service representatives can’t resolve and you
    wish to pursue arbitration, you must first send an individualized Notice of
    Dispute to
    <strong
      >Microsoft Corporation, ATTN: CELA Arbitration, One Microsoft Way,
      Redmond, WA 98052-6399, U.S.A., or submit the form electronically.</strong
    >
    The Notice of Dispute form is available at
    <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=245499" target="_blank"
      >https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=245499</a
    >. Complete that form in full, with all the information it requires. We’ll
    do the same if we have a dispute with you. This Notice of Dispute is a
    prerequisite to initiating any arbitration. Any applicable statute of
    limitations will be tolled from the date of a properly submitted
    individualized Notice of Dispute through the first date on which an
    arbitration may properly be filed under this section 15.
  </li>
  <li>
    c. <strong>Small Claims Court Option.</strong> Instead of sending a Notice
    of Dispute, either you or we may sue the other party in small claims court
    seeking only individualized relief, so long as the action meets the small
    claims court’s requirements and remains an individual action seeking
    individualized relief. The small claims court must be in your county of
    residence (or, if a business, your principal place of business).
  </li>
  <li>
    d. <strong>Arbitration Procedure.</strong> The AAA will conduct any
    arbitration under its Commercial Arbitration Rules (or if you are an
    individual and use the Services for personal or household use, or if the
    value of the dispute is less than $75,000 whether or not you are an
    individual or how you use the Services, its Consumer Arbitration Rules). The
    AAA’s Mass Arbitration Supplementary Rules, as modified by this section 15,
    will apply in Related Cases (discussed below). For more information, see
    <a href="https://www.adr.org/" target="_blank">www.adr.org</a>.
    <strong
      >Section 15 and these Terms govern to the extent they conflict with any
      applicable AAA rules.</strong
    >
    To initiate an arbitration, submit the Demand for Arbitration form available
    at
    <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=245497" target="_blank"
      >https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=245497</a
    >
    to the AAA and mail a copy to us. The form must contain information that is
    specific to you and your claim. In a dispute involving $25,000 or less, any
    hearing will be telephonic or by videoconference unless the arbitrator finds
    good cause to hold an in-person hearing instead. Any in-person hearing will
    take place in your county of residence (or, if a business, your principal
    place of business). The arbitrator may award the same damages to you
    individually as a court could.
    <strong
      >The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only to you
      individually to satisfy your individual claim, but not relief that would
      affect non-parties.</strong
    >
    <p>
      The arbitrator rules on all issues except that a court has exclusive
      authority: (i) to decide arbitrability, as well as formation, existence,
      scope, validity, and enforceability of this arbitration agreement; (ii) to
      decide whether the parties have complied with the pre-arbitration
      requirements (including the individualized Notice of Dispute and Demand
      for Arbitration forms); (iii) to enforce the prohibition on class,
      representative, private attorney-general, or combined actions or
      proceedings, or public injunctive relief; and (iv) to enjoin an
      arbitration from proceeding if it does not comply with this section 15.
    </p>
    <p>
      If your Notice of Dispute involves claims similar to those of at least 24
      other customers, and if you and those other customers are represented by
      the same lawyers, or by lawyers who are coordinating with each other, you
      and we agree that these claims will be “Related Cases.” You and we agree
      that the AAA’s Mass Arbitration Supplementary Rules in effect when the
      Demand for Arbitration is filed, as modified by this section 15, will
      apply to Related Cases. Related Cases may only be filed in batches of up
      to 50 individual arbitrations at a time, and those individual arbitrations
      will be resolved in the following manner: (i) for the first batch, each
      side may select up to 25 of these Related Cases to be filed and resolved
      in individual arbitrations under this section 15; (ii) none of the other
      Related Cases may be filed or prosecuted in arbitration until the first
      batch of up to 50 individual arbitrations is resolved; and (iii) if, after
      that first batch, the parties are unable to resolve the remaining Related
      Cases, a second batch of Related Cases may be filed, where each side may
      select up to 25 of the Related Cases to be resolved in individual
      arbitrations under this section 15. This process of batched individual
      arbitrations will continue until the parties resolve all Related Cases
      informally or through individual arbitrations. A court has exclusive
      authority to enforce this paragraph, including whether it applies to a
      given set of claims, and to enjoin the filing or prosecution of
      arbitrations that do not comply with this paragraph.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    e. <strong>Arbitration Fees and Payments.</strong> The AAA rules will govern
    payment of filing fees and the AAA’s arbitrator’s fees and expenses.
    <ul>
      <li>
        In addition, if the dispute is not part of the Related Cases described
        above, the dispute involves less than $75,000, and before initiating
        arbitration you complied with all pre-arbitration requirements in this
        section 15, then (1) we will promptly reimburse your filing fees and pay
        the AAA’s and arbitrator’s fees and expenses; and (2) if, at the
        conclusion of the arbitration, the arbitrator awards you more than our
        last written offer made before the arbitrator was appointed, we will:
        pay you (i) the amount of the award or $1,000 (whichever is more); and;
        (ii) for any reasonable attorney’s fees you incurred; and any reasonable
        expenses (including expert witness fees and costs) that your attorney
        accrued in connection with your individual arbitration.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    f. <strong>Rejecting Future Arbitration Changes.</strong> You may reject any
    change we make to section 15 (except address changes) by personally signing
    and sending us notice within 30 days of the change by U.S. Mail to the
    address in section 15.b. If you do, the most recent version of section 15
    before the change you rejected will apply.
  </li>
  <li>
    g. <strong>Severability.</strong> If, after exhaustion of all appeals, a
    court finds any part of this section 15 unenforceable as to any claim or
    request for a remedy, then the parties agree to arbitrate all claims and
    remedies subject to arbitration before litigating in court any remaining
    claims or remedies (such as a request for a public injunction remedy, in
    which case the arbitrator issues an award on liability and individual relief
    before a court considers that request). Otherwise, if any other part of
    section 15 is found to be unenforceable, the remainder will remain in effect
    (with an arbitration award issued before any court proceeding begins).
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Miscellaneous</h2>
<p>
  16. <strong>Miscellaneous.</strong> This section, and sections 1, 9 (for
  amounts incurred before the end of these Terms), 10, 11, 12, 13, 15, 18 and
  those that by their terms apply after the Terms end will survive any
  termination or cancellation of these Terms. We may assign these Terms, in
  whole or in part, at any time without notice to you. You may not assign your
  rights or obligations under these Terms or transfer any rights to use the
  Services. This is the entire agreement between you and Microsoft for your use
  of the Services. It supersedes any prior agreements between you and Microsoft
  regarding your use of the Services. All parts of these Terms apply to the
  maximum extent permitted by relevant law. If a court or arbitrator holds that
  we can't enforce a part of these Terms as written, we may replace those terms
  with similar terms to the extent enforceable under the relevant law, but the
  rest of these Terms won't change. Section 15.g says what happens if parts of
  section 15 (arbitration and class action waiver) are found to be
  unenforceable. Section 15.g prevails over this section if inconsistent with
  it. Except for section 15 (arbitration and class action waiver) these Terms
  are solely for your and our benefit; they aren’t for the benefit of any other
  person, except for Microsoft’s successors and assigns.

  international export laws and regulations that apply to the software and/or

  18. <strong>Reservation of Rights and Feedback.</strong> Except as expressly
  provided under these Terms, Microsoft does not grant you a license or any
  other rights of any type under any patents, know-how, copyrights, trade
  secrets, trademarks or other intellectual property owned or controlled by
  Microsoft or any related entity, including but not limited to any name, trade
  dress, logo or equivalents. If you give to Microsoft any idea, proposal,
  suggestion or feedback, including without limitation ideas for new products,
  technologies, promotions, product names, product feedback and product
  improvements ("<strong>Feedback</strong>"), you give to Microsoft, without
  charge, royalties or other obligation to you, the right to make, have made,
  create derivative works, use, share and commercialize your Feedback in any way
  and for any purpose. You will not give Feedback that is subject to a license
  that requires Microsoft to license its software, technologies or documentation
  to any third party because Microsoft includes your Feedback in them.
