        <br />Meta AIs Terms of Service<br />
        <p>
          These Terms of Service (“Terms”) apply when you access and use Meta
          AIs and other software, tools, services, documentation, content,
          functionalities, and generative AI features that we make available to
          you through any Meta product (collectively, “AIs”). These terms are a
          legally binding agreement between you and Meta Platforms, Inc.
          (“Meta”, “we”, “our”, or “us”). By using AIs, you agree to be bound by
          these Terms, the
          <a href="https://www.facebook.com/terms.php">Meta Terms of Service</a
          >, and any other applicable terms and policies.
        </p>
        <p><br /><strong>1. Your Commitments</strong></p>
        <br />
        <p>A. Eligibility</p>
        <p>
          Without limiting the
          <a href="https://www.facebook.com/terms.php">Meta Terms of Service</a>
          or any other applicable terms or policies, you cannot access AIs if
          you are under the age of 13 (or such greater age required in your
          country or territory) or if you are prohibited from receiving our
          services or software under applicable laws.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>B. Acceptable Uses</p>
        <p>
          You may not access, use, or allow others to access or use AIs in any
          matter that would:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Violate any applicable law (including but not limited to any manner
            that promotes, contributes to, or encourages illegal or unlawful
            activity), including conduct that describes, encourages, supports,
            or distributes in any form child sexual abuse materials
          </li>
          <li>
            Generate, promote, disseminate, or otherwise use or facilitate
            content that may harm other individuals, including to encourage
            self-harm, discrimination, bullying, humiliation, and/or other
            emotional harms. This also includes causing harm by using AIs to:
            (i) deploy subliminal, manipulative, or deceptive techniques to
            distort behavior by impairing decision making; or (ii) exploit
            people due to their age, disability, or a specific social or
            economic situation to distort their behavior
          </li>
          <li>
            Present a risk of death or bodily harm to individuals (including in
            relation to illegal drugs, weapons, or self-harm)
          </li>
          <li>
            Generate, promote, disseminate, or otherwise use or facilitate adult
            content, such as erotic chat, pornography, and content meant to
            arouse sexual excitement
          </li>
          <li>
            Deceive or mislead others, including but not limited to activity
            related to plagiarism, scams, phishing or malware, and furtherance
            of misinformation or disinformation
          </li>
          <li>
            Generate, promote, disseminate, or otherwise use or facilitate
            content that may violate or infringe upon the rights of others
            (including but not limited to intellectual property rights and
            privacy rights)
          </li>
          <li>
            Solicit professional advice (including but not limited to medical,
            psychological, financial, or legal advice) or content to be used for
            the purpose of engaging in other regulated activities (including but
            not limited to political campaigning or lobbying). No statements,
            responses, or content generated by AIs should be interpreted as an
            offer or provision of professional care or as a substitute for
            consultation with a qualified provider.
          </li>
          <li>Override safety or privacy filters, controls, or mechanisms</li>
        </ul>
        <p><br /><strong>2. Prompts, Results, and Other Content</strong></p>
        <br />
        <p>A. Rights to Content</p>
        <p>
          AIs allows you to provide materials for processing, which could
          include text, documents, images, or recordings, depending on the
          integration (together, “Prompts”) and will generate a response
          (“Outputs”) based on your Prompts, as well as any feedback you provide
          (“Feedback”) collectively, “Content”. You may not provide prompts or
          use AIs in any way that infringes or violates someone else’s rights,
          including intellectual property rights. Except as expressly provided
          in these Terms, you retain all right, title, and interest – including
          any intellectual property rights – that you have in and to your
          Prompts. You agree that your provision of Prompts will not violate
          these Terms, including the Acceptable Uses, and other policies that
          apply to your use of AIs, which we may supplement, update, or revise,
          at any time.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>B. Personal Information</p>
        <p>
          The
          <a href="https://www.facebook.com/privacy/policy/"
            >Meta Privacy Policy</a
          >
          governs our processing of personal information collected through the
          AIs and explains how we collect, use, and share personal information -
          including personal information you submit as Prompts, Feedback, or
          other Content, your activity across our products, and personal
          information we collect from and about your device. We may process
          personal information, including any sensitive information, as
          described in the Privacy Policy, to improve AIs and related
          technology.
        </p>
        <p>
          When information is shared with AIs, the AIs may retain and use that
          information to provide more personalized Outputs. Do not share
          information that you don’t want the AIs to use and retain such as
          account identifiers, passwords, financial information, or other
          sensitive information.
        </p>
        <p>
          Meta may share certain information about you that is processed when
          using the AIs with third parties who help us provide you with more
          relevant or useful responses. For example, we may share questions
          contained in a Prompt with a third-party search engine, and include
          the search results in the response to your Prompt. The information we
          share with third parties may contain personal information if your
          Prompt contains personal information about any person. By using AIs,
          you are instructing us to share your information with third parties
          when it may provide you with more relevant or useful responses. Those
          third parties will use any information we share – which may include
          personal information about you or others – in accordance with those
          third parties’ privacy policies. You can view the list of these third
          parties, and links to their privacy policies, by visiting our
          <a href="https://www.facebook.com/privacy/dialog/ai-partners"
            >Privacy Center</a
          >. We may add or remove third parties from time to time, and notice
          will be provided solely by adding or removing that party from the list
          referenced above.
        </p>
        <p>
          Meta may review your interactions with AIs, including the content of
          your conversations with or messages to AIs, and this review may be
          automated or manual (human). When you share your private messages with
          friends and family for AI features that use Private Processing
          technology, Meta cannot read or access the messages you have shared.
          Meta provides Private Processing as a service on your behalf.
        </p>
        <p>
          Depending on where you reside, you or an authorized agent may request
          access to your personal information from Meta in a portable format,
          deletion of your personal information, or correction of your personal
          information, subject to certain exceptions. To learn more about how
          you can access and delete your personal information associated with
          AIs, and exercise any applicable rights, visit our
          <a
            href="https://www.facebook.com/privacy/guide/genai?entry_point=whatsapp_genai"
            >Privacy Center</a
          >. It is important that you review the Privacy Center before you try
          to delete any personal information or delete or deactivate your
          account. Depending on how you use AIs, deleting individual messages,
          entire threads, or even your account may not delete our copy of your
          personal information, and the Privacy Center describes the correct way
          to delete your personal information.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>C. Accuracy</p>
        <p>
          <strong>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW,</strong> META MAKES NO
          REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES WITH RESPECT TO THE ACCURACY OF ANY
          CONTENT, INCLUDING OUTPUTS, OR ANY OUTPUTS THAT ARE DISTURBING OR
          UPSETTING. YOU SHOULD NOT RELY UPON OUTPUTS FOR ANY PURPOSE OR USE
          OUTPUTS TO INFORM PROFESSIONAL ADVICE OR DECISIONS RELATED TO
          MEDICINE, FINANCE, LAW, OR PHARMACEUTICALS. IF YOU PLAN TO USE OUTPUTS
          FOR ANY REASON, IT IS YOUR SOLE RESPONSIBILITY TO VERIFY OUTPUTS. AIS
          AND ANY CONTENT MAY NOT REFLECT ACCURATE, COMPLETE, OR CURRENT
          INFORMATION.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>D. Warning Regarding Content</p>
        <p>
          The AIs will generate Content based on Prompts that you provide. The
          specific Content that the AIs will return based on your Prompts cannot
          be predicted in advance. AIs MIGHT GENERATE CONTENT THAT YOU CONSIDER
          OFFENSIVE OR OBJECTIONABLE AND/OR THAT DOES NOT REPRESENT META’S
          VIEWS. BY AGREEING TO THESE TERMS AND BY USING AIS, YOU RECOGNIZE AND
          ASSUME THE RISK THAT THE PROMPTS YOU PROVIDE MIGHT RESULT IN
          GENERATION OF CONTENT THAT YOU CONSIDER OFFENSIVE OR OBJECTIONABLE.
          YOU ALSO RECOGNIZE AND AGREE THAT YOU – NOT META – ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR
          YOUR USE OF, AND/OR ANY ACTIONS YOU TAKE IN RELATION TO, CONTENT
          GENERATED BY THE AIS BASED ON YOUR PROMPTS.
        </p>
        <p><br /><strong>3. Meta's Rights</strong></p>
        <br />
        <p>A. Meta’s Rights Regarding Content</p>
        <p>
          Meta may use Content and related information as described in the Meta
          Terms of Service and Meta Privacy Policy, and may do so through
          automated or manual (i.e. human) review and through third-party
          vendors in some instances, including:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>To provide, maintain, and improve Meta services and features.</li>
          <li>To conduct and support research</li>
          <li>
            To monitor your use of AIs for compliance with these Terms and
            applicable laws and to report violations of applicable laws or
            regulations as required by law
          </li>
          <li>
            To remove unsafe, discriminatory, or other Content that violates
            these Terms, Meta’s Community Standards, or any other applicable
            policies and terms
          </li>
          <li>
            To suspend or remove accounts that violate these Terms with respect
            to your use of AIs
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <p>B. Suspension and Termination</p>
        <p>
          If we determine that you have breached these Terms or other applicable
          terms and policies, we may suspend or permanently disable your access
          to AIs or other Meta services or features, and we may permanently
          disable or delete your account including where we are required to do
          so for legal reasons.
        </p>
        <p><br /><strong>4. Image Processing</strong></p>
        <p>
          Depending on where you are located, you may have the option to share
          images with AIs. Once shared, you agree that Meta will analyze those
          images, including facial features, using AI. This processing allows us
          to offer innovative new features, including the ability to summarize
          image contents, modify images, and generate new content based on the
          image. You further agree that you will not upload images to Meta AI
          that you know to contain individuals that reside in Illinois or Texas,
          unless you are their legally authorized representative and consent on
          their behalf.
        </p>
        <p><br /><strong>5. Ownership of AIs</strong></p>
        <p>
          We retain all our respective rights, title, and interest, including
          intellectual property rights, in and to AIs. Other than the rights of
          access and use expressly granted in these Terms, these Terms do not
          grant you any right, title, or interest in or to the AIs.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p><strong>6. Third Party Materials</strong></p>
        <p>
          AIs may use or be used in connection with content, services, features,
          and integrations provided by third parties. Meta is not responsible
          for your use of third party content, services, features, and
          integrations, and you use these at your own risk.

            >7. Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitations on Liability</strong
          >
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>A. Disclaimer of Warranties</p>
        <p>
          AIs and Outputs are provided on an “as is” and “as available” basis,
          and<strong>, </strong>to the maximum extent permitted by applicable
          law, we make no guarantees that they will be safe, secure, or
          error-free, or will function without disruptions, delays, or
          imperfections. To the maximum extent permitted by law, we are not
          responsible for Outputs, and you are responsible for checking Outputs
          for accuracy and suitability. The Outputs provided by AIs do not
          reflect the views of Meta, our affiliates, or our personnel.
        </p>
        <p>
          TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE DISCLAIM ANY AND ALL
          WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING THE IMPLIED
          WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE,
          TITLE, ACCURACY, AVAILABILITY, SECURITY, PRIVACY, COMPATIBILITY,
          NON-INFRINGEMENT, AND ANY WARRANTY IMPLIED BY COURSE OF DEALING,
          COURSE OF PERFORMANCE, OR TRADE USAGE.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>B. Limitations on Liability</p>
        <p>
          Our liability shall be limited to the fullest extent permitted by
          applicable law, and under no circumstance will we be liable to you for
          any lost profits, revenues, information, or data, or consequential,
          special, indirect, exemplary, punitive, or incidental damages arising
          out of or related to these Terms or AIs (however caused and on any
          theory of liability, including negligence), even if we have been
          advised of the possibility of such damages.
        </p>
        <p>
          The laws of some states or jurisdictions may not allow the exclusion
          or limitation of certain damages, so some or all of the exclusions and
          limitations set out above may not apply to you. Notwithstanding
          anything to the contrary in these Terms, in such cases, Meta’s
          liability will be limited to the fullest extent permitted by
          applicable law.
        </p>
        <p><br /><strong>8. Disputes</strong></p>
        <p>
          Any claim, cause of action, or dispute that arises out of or relates
          to these Meta AIs Terms is subject to the disputes resolution clause
          in the Meta Terms of Service.
        </p>
        <p><br /><strong>9. Severability</strong></p>
        <p>
          If any portion of these Terms is found to be unenforceable, the
          unenforceable portion will be deemed amended to the minimum extent
          necessary to make it enforceable, and if it can’t be made enforceable,
          then it will be severed and the remaining portion will remain in full
          force and effect. If we fail to enforce any of these Terms, it will
          not be considered a waiver. Any amendment to or waiver of these Terms
          must be made in writing and signed by us.
        </p>
        <p><br /><strong>10. Changes to These Terms</strong></p>
        <p>
          We work constantly to improve our services and develop new features to
          make our products better for you and our community. As a result, we
          may need to update these Terms from time to time to accurately reflect
          our services and practices, to promote a safe and secure experience,
          and/or to comply with applicable law. Unless otherwise required by
          law, we will notify you (for example through email or in-app
          notification) of any material changes to these Terms and give you an
          opportunity to review them before they go into effect. Once any
          updated Terms are in effect you will be bound by them if you continue
          to use our <strong>AIs</strong>. If you do not agree to the updated
          Terms, you should stop using AIs before they go into effect.
        </p>
