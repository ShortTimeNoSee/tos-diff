<h1>Supplemental Meta Platforms Technologies Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>Effective April 29, 2025</p>
<p>
  This Supplemental Privacy Policy supplements the
  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/privacy/policy/" target="_blank">Meta Privacy Policy</a> and applies to your and
  your child’s use of a Meta account and access to
  <a href="/legal/quest/meta-platforms-technologies-products/" target="_self">Meta Platforms Technologies Products</a>.
</p>
<p>
  If you are a parent or guardian of a child between the ages of 10 and 12 (age may vary by region) and wish to create a
  Meta account for your child, please review the
  <a href="/help/159846217080224/" target="_self">Parent Privacy Disclosure</a> that describes how Meta collects, uses,
  and discloses your child’s personal information. After you create a Meta account for your child, we will collect, use,
  and disclose your child’s information much like any other Meta account. This Supplemental Privacy Policy applies in
  full to both adults and children. To the extent there are privacy practices specific to your child’s Meta account,
  those differences are outlined in the Children’s Privacy Highlight at the top of each relevant section of this
  Supplemental Privacy Policy. Note, the Meta Privacy Policy does not apply to the processing of your child’s personal
  information.

</p>
<ul>

    <p>
      Meta Horizon profile: If your use of a Meta VR Product requires you to create a

  <li>
    <p>Physical characteristics and movements: We collect information about or related to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          The position and orientation of the headset and controls to determine body pose and make your avatar’s
          movements more realistic.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The position of your headset, the speed of your controller movement, and changes in your orientation (such as

        <p>
          Hand and Body Tracking. For hand and body tracking in Meta VR Products, we process abstracted hand and body
          data to allow you to switch between hands and controllers to interact with your surroundings and have a more
          seamless or immersive experience. Hand and body tracking also helps make your avatar’s movements look more

        <p>
          We also collect and retain certain data about your interactions with hand and body tracking (such as tracking
          quality and the amount of time it takes to detect your hands and body), to provide the feature and ensure it
          works properly. Learn more in our

          quality, help you interact with virtual content in an app, and to animate your avatar’s eye and facial
          movements. Raw image data of your eyes is processed on your device.
        </p>
        <p>
          We also collect and retain certain data about your interactions with eye tracking (such as tracking quality

      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Fit Adjustment. For fit adjustment in Meta Quest Pro, we process abstracted fit adjustment data to check

      <li>Apps you download</li>
      <li>
        The time, frequency, and duration of your activities on our Meta VR Products. For example, we collect
        information about your <a href="/help/quest/835071900437494/" target="_self">Meta Quest browser</a> usage, such
        as interactions with recommended WebVR experiences, which browser features you use, and other statistics.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Content: We collect content you create on Meta VR Products, such as a picture you post or an object you build. We
      also collect information about this content, such as the date and time you created it.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Fitness information: When you enable fitness-related experiences on Meta VR Products, such as Meta Quest Move, we

      achievements. <a href="/help/quest/articles/in-vr-experiences/oculus-apps/" target="_self">Learn more</a>.

    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Environmental information and dimensions: We collect information about your physical environment and its
      dimensions when you use a Meta VR Product. For example, we may collect information about the size of walls,
      surfaces, and objects in your room and the distances between them and your headset to offer experiences that blend
      your virtual and real-world environments.
      <a href="/help/quest/articles/in-vr-experiences/oculus-features/point-cloud/" target="_self">Learn More</a>.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Camera and audio information: When cameras and microphones are on in Meta VR Products, we collect:</p>
    <p></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Camera information, including photo and video. For example, the sensors on Meta Quest process raw images of your
        surroundings and enable the headset to both process your movement and help orient you in your designated virtual
        reality areas. Raw images of your surroundings are processed on your device.
      </li>
      <li>When you choose to turn on your microphone in Worlds, we may collect recorded audio.</li>
      <li>
        Video or audio content you create and information about this content, such as the date and time you created it.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      Additionally, when you use Worlds, the last few minutes of your and other users’ most recent audio, video and
      other interactions in Worlds are recorded in case you want to report anything you’ve encountered. These recordings
      may be stored on our servers. We do not review these recordings unless you submit a report. If you don't submit a
      report, the recordings are deleted on a rolling basis. These recordings enable you to report abuse, combat harmful
      conduct, and protect and support our community. Other users in close proximity to you in Worlds may submit
      recordings of the same event. If you submit a report, we use the attached recordings to investigate and fully
      resolve the report, and to help train our systems to better combat harmful behavior, after which time the
      recordings are deleted. In some cases, we may need to retain the recordings for longer, where it is necessary in
      order to comply with applicable law.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Voice conversations with Meta AI: Voice conversations with Meta AI are the commands and dictations you say,
      including if you mistakenly invoke our voice services, as well as any background sound that happens when you use
      those services. When you use our voice services, we process:
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Audio recordings</li>
      <li>Transcripts</li>
      <li>
        Related data about your voice conversations with Meta AI, such as the hardware version of your device and the
        length of the audio related to your conversation
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      We process this information so we can respond to your requests, provide the requested service to you, and,
      depending on your settings, improve our voice services. Learn more in our
      <a href="/help/quest/articles/in-vr-experiences/oculus-features/voice-dictation-privacy-notice/" target="_self"

    </p>
    <p>
      Please note that third-party services may offer their own app voice experiences. When you use those services,
      information collected by these third-party services is subject to their own terms and privacy policies, not this
      policy. You can learn more about how we collect and use information from other features you interact with on Meta
      Quest in our

      <li>Third-party service usage</li>
      <li>Crash reports</li>
    </ul>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      When a Meta VR Product experiences a crash, a log about the crash is sent to Meta. This log includes, among other
      things, the date and time of the crash, your user ID, device ID, IP address, and very small fragments of
      information from any camera or microphone in use at the time of the crash. These crash logs are only retained and
      used to diagnose and fix problems with Meta VR Products or other apps and services used on Meta VR Products.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can choose to share additional data with Meta about how you use your device to help us personalize your
      experiences and improve Meta VR Products. <a href="/help/614185856801362/" target="_self">Learn more</a>.

    <p>
      Information from partners and third parties: When you use a third party service on Meta VR Products, we collect

    <ul>
      <li>How often and for how long it’s used</li>
      <li>Crash log information if it crashes</li>
      <li>An authorization token if it requires a login</li>

    <p></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Third-party apps</li>
      <li>Developers</li>
      <li>Other online content providers</li>
      <li>Marketing partners</li>
      <li>
        Platforms not controlled by Meta on which you may access or use Meta VR Products without a Meta Account or
        Horizon Profile. If you are accessing a Meta VR Product on a platform not controlled by Meta, that platform’s
        terms and policies also apply.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      For example, in Meta Quest, we receive information from developers about your achievements in their apps and about
      what features you can use in their app. To learn about how a third-party service processes or shares your
      information, please refer to their terms and privacy policies.

    <ul>
      <li>
        Your child’s Meta Horizon profile will be set to private by default, which means all followers will have to be
        approved by you or your child. Your child’s display name, username, and profile picture will always be visible
        to other Meta Quest users who can search for your child and send follow requests.

      To provide and improve our Meta VR Products: We use information we collect, including device performance and
      reliability data, to improve and develop Meta VR Products. By analyzing device performance and reliability, we can
      improve the hardware and software that powers your experiences with Meta VR Products. We also use your device
      performance and reliability information to offer and improve aspects of our services, such as voice services, hand
      and body tracking, eye tracking, Natural Facial Expressions, fit adjustment, and fitness-related experiences.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          If you use our voice services on Meta VR Products, depending on your settings, we analyze and review
          information about your stored voice conversations with Meta AI using human review and machine processes to
          improve, troubleshoot, and train our speech recognition systems.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          When you use the hand and body tracking feature in Meta Quest devices, we collect technical information, like
          tracking quality, the amount of time it takes to detect your hands and body, and the number of gestures you
          make to improve and troubleshoot this feature.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          When you use the eye tracking feature in Meta Quest Pro, we collect certain data about your interactions with
          the feature, such as tracking quality and the amount of time it takes to detect your eyes.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>

          interactions with the feature, such as how the headset fit affects the quality of detected facial movements
          and how much time it takes to detect expressions.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>

<p>III. How is your information shared with others for Meta VR Products?</p>
<hr />
Children's Privacy Highlights
<ul>
  <li>
    We may share information about your child’s age category (excluding birth date) with third parties such as app
    developers.
  </li>
  <li>
    We may share certain information about your child and/or teen, such as the fact that they have a parent-managed Meta
    account and the apps they have, with other users who are managed or supervised by the same parent or guardian.
  </li>
  <li>
    When you approve your child’s app purchases and downloads, we will share certain information about your child such
    as Meta Horizon profile data, followers, blocked users, subscriptions, personal identifiers, app invites, and in-app
    purchases and destinations with app developers.
  </li>
  <li>
    Your child’s activity, such as apps your child has used and achievements in those apps, will be visible to their
    followers.
  </li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>
  In addition to the sharing of information described in the Meta Privacy Policy, we share the information we collect
  when you use the Meta VR Products in the following ways:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Information you make public: Your Meta Horizon Profile information will be public and visible to people on and off
      the Meta VR Products. This includes your profile name, username, picture, and avatar.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, if you enter a public virtual space in Meta Quest, others can see your avatar just as they see you in
      a real-world public space. This means your avatar can appear in pictures, recordings, or live streams that users
      around you take and share. Information that you post to public areas on the Meta VR Products, such as a forum,
      blog, or other community tool, will also be visible to people on and off Meta VR Products, along with certain
      information associated with your public posts, such as the time of your post.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Third-party services &amp; applications: You can interact with applications and third-party services, including
      content, games, apps, and other experiences, through many Meta VR Products. If you use services from a third
      party, we share information about you with the third-party service so it can provide you with the service you’ve
      requested.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, we share the following Meta Horizon profile information with apps you use so you can appear as your
      Meta Horizon profile in those apps:
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Avatar</li>
      <li>Username</li>
      <li>Profile name and picture</li>
      <li>List of the people you follow and those who follow you</li>
      <li>
        Your interactions with the app or third-party service, such as how long you’ve interacted with their content
      </li>
      <li>Any other information you choose to share with the app or third-party service</li>
    </ul>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      If you use third-party services on Meta VR Products, the third-party services may collect information from you
      directly through the experiences they provide.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, you can also choose to share information with third-party services from Meta VR Products, for example:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          You can choose to share your Meta Quest fitness and activity information with third parties to sync that
          information with third-party fitness services.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          If you enable eye tracking or Natural Facial Expressions in Meta Quest Pro, apps can access your abstracted
          gaze or abstracted facial expressions data. Please note that information you share with these (or other)
          third-party services will be subject to their own terms and privacy policies, not this policy.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Information that you provide when playing online: When you use online multi-user apps in Meta Quest, your activity
      and other information you provide are visible to all within the app, including your:
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Avatar</li>
      <li>In-app profile information</li>
      <li>In-app activity</li>
    </ul>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      This information (including your voice or audio) can be collected, copied, recorded, and live-streamed by other
      users, shared on and off Meta VR Products, and submitted to us to report abuse, combat harmful conduct, and
      protect and support our community.

  <li>
    <p>
      Third party access to voice conversations with Meta AI: Depending on your settings, we share recordings,
      transcripts, and related data about your voice conversations with Meta AI with vendors and service providers who
      assist us in improving, troubleshooting, and training our speech recognition systems.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    If your Meta account is managed by an organization (i.e, a “Managed Meta Account”), we also share with that
    organization certain information about your account, to promote safety, integrity and security; to comply with
    applicable laws and regulations; and in accordance with Meta’s terms and policies, including the applicable
    Acceptable Use Policy. This may include information such as the status of your account, the approximate location of
    your managed headset, and information about applications you install and how you use them. Please review your
    organization’s policies or contact your organization’s administrator to learn more about the information shared with
    your organization and the settings and access controls established by your organization.

Meta Wearable Products
<hr />
Children's Privacy Highlights
<ul>
  <li>
    As described in the
    <a href="/legal/supplemental-terms-of-service/" target="_self"
      >Supplemental Meta Platforms Technologies Terms of Service</a
    >, children below the age of 13 are not permitted to use Meta Wearable Products. Therefore, a Meta account for a
    child between the ages of 10 and 12 (age may vary by region) cannot be used to log into the companion app (the “Meta
    AI App”).
  </li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>
  Meta Wearable Products provide a wearable experience that lets you interact with your environment in new and
  innovative ways. Meta Wearable Products include any Ray-Ban | Meta AI glasses within the Ray-Ban | Meta collection and
  the Ray-Ban Stories (collectively, the “AI Glasses”) that pair with the Meta AI app (the “App”). Meta software powers
  the features available on the AI Glasses. Meta Wearable Products include the AI Glasses and the software and services
  in the Meta AI App that relate to them. Available features and functionality vary depending on the Meta Wearable
  Product and your location.
</p>
<p>
  If you communicate and share content from your Meta Wearable Products using other
  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/195227921252400?ref=dp" target="_blank">Meta Company Products</a>, information
  relating to your use of the Meta Company Product will be subject to their applicable terms and policies.
</p>
<p>I. What information do we collect for Meta Wearable Products?</p>
<p>
  In addition to the information described in the Meta Privacy Policy under "<a
    href="https://www.facebook.com/privacy/policy/?section_id=1-WhatInformationDoWe"
    target="_blank"
    >What information do we collect?</a
  >", and in this Supplemental Privacy Policy under “What information do we collect for Meta Accounts?”, we collect the
  following categories of information when you use Meta Wearable Products:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Photo, video, and audio information: When you use the AI Glasses to take a photo or video, the cameras and
      microphones on the AI Glasses are activated and the following information is collected:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Photos, videos, and audio. You can use the AI Glasses to take photos and video recordings with audio
          (together, “Media”). This Media is captured on your AI Glasses and sent to your App. We will process your
          Media when you turn on cloud processing on your AI Glasses, interact with the Meta AI service on your AI
          glasses, or upload your Media to certain services provided by Meta (i.e., Facebook or Instagram). You can
          change your choices about cloud processing of your Media at any time in Settings.
        </p>
        <p>
          If available, you can use your AI glasses to live stream. Video and audio content from your live stream will
          be processed through the Meta Company Product you live stream from (i.e., Facebook or Instagram). The video
          and audio content from your live stream will not be stored on your Ray-Ban | Meta AI glasses after you finish
          a live streaming session or in the App. Your use of a Meta Company Product to live stream will be subject to
          the terms and policies of that Meta Company Product.
        </p>
        <p>
          If available, you can use your Ray-Ban | Meta AI glasses to translate live conversations into a different
          language. The audio recordings and the transcripts generated when you use the feature are processed on your
          Ray-Ban | Meta AI glasses and in the Meta AI App. The audio recordings and transcripts are deleted after you
          are done using the feature.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Metadata. We collect metadata, such as the date and time you created content, whether it’s a photo or a video
          recording, and technical information about your camera or other AI Glasses sensors related to content.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Location-related information: When you choose to share your mobile device’s location with the Meta AI App by
      turning on the Location Services device setting, we collect location-related information that you allow us to
      receive. This includes things like the location where you used your Ray-Ban | Meta AI glasses to take photos and
      video recordings for the geotagging feature. Location-related information includes your general location or
      precise location that you choose and control through your mobile device settings. You can change your preferences
      about collecting location-related information at any time in your mobile device settings.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you interact with the Meta AI service on your Ray-Ban | Meta AI glasses, the Meta AI service may process
      Media in connection with requests to understand what you are looking at, which may include understanding your
      general location, to provide you with a more relevant and useful service.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Device information: In addition to the information described in the Meta Privacy Policy under the “<a
        href="https://www.facebook.com/privacy/policy?subpage=1.subpage.3-AppBrowserAndDevice"
        target="_blank"
        >App, browser and device</a
      >” section, we collect and use "Essential Data” about your AI Glasses when you use them. You can also choose to
      share "Additional Data" about your use of your AI Glasses as explained below. Essential and Additional Data are
      associated with other information, like your User ID, Device ID, and information about your device model and
      operating system.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Essential Data is information needed to ensure the AI Glasses work as expected, meet user expectations, and
          provide the service outlined in the Terms of Service. For example, we collect information to perform certain
          actions on the AI Glasses and to see whether they are working correctly, like if the bluetooth is functioning.
          In addition, similar to other devices, if the AI Glasses crash or malfunction, a log is sent to Meta that
          includes information from the time of the crash event, such as the date and time of the crash and how you were
          using your AI Glasses immediately before the crash event. These crash logs are only retained and used to
          diagnose and fix problems with you AI Glasses. Essential Data is automatically shared with Meta.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Additional Data is information we collect when you use your AI Glasses that helps Meta improve and personalize
          your user experience and develop and improve Meta Products. Additional Data includes information like
          analytics about AI Glasses usage to help us develop new features and products to provide a better user
          experience. Meta will use Additional Data for these purposes if you choose to share Additional Data with Meta
          during your initial setup, and you can change your choice at any time in Settings.

</ul>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Third-party services: When a third-party service is used on the AI Glasses, like a music player, depending on how
      the service works, we may collect information about how you use it. This includes how often and for how long you
      use it, crash log information if it crashes, and an authorization token if required for log-in. Third-party
      services may share information with us when their service is used on the AI Glasses. To learn about how
      third-party services process your information, please refer to their terms and privacy policies.

  >", including (i) to provide measurement, analytics and other promotional services (including ads and commercial
  content); (ii) to promote safety, security, and integrity; (iii) to communicate with you; and (iv) to research and
  innovate for social good, we use the information we collect in the following ways:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Provide our services. This includes providing services and features of the AI Glasses, helping make the AI Glasses
      and the Meta AI App work properly, and maintaining safety, security, and integrity. For example, we collect
      information to see whether the Meta AI App is working correctly, like whether the AI Glasses and the Meta AI App
      are pairing properly. We also collect information to make sure it’s you, like when you sign into the Meta AI App
      with your Meta account or perform certain actions on the AI Glasses and Meta AI App such as to send a message or
      start a call. If you choose to turn on cloud processing on your AI Glasses, your photos and videos will be sent
      from the Meta AI App to Meta servers to support additional photo and video features. When you use the Meta AI
      service on your Ray-Ban | Meta AI glasses, we use your information, like Media and audio recordings of your voice

  >”
</p>
<p>
  When you use the Meta AI service on your Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses, we may share your information, like the prompt you
  use when you ask Meta AI a question, or a photo you take to ask Meta AI a question, with third parties as described in
  Meta’s <a href="https://www.facebook.com/legal/ai-terms/" target="_blank">AI Terms</a>. You can view a list of these
  third parties and links to their privacy policies by visiting our
  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/privacy/dialog/ai-partners/" target="_blank">Privacy Center</a>.

  When you use a third-party service on your AI Glasses, like a music player, we may share information with the
  third-party service to complete your requests, like when you ask your Ray-Ban | Meta AI glasses to play a song or a
  meditation. We may also share information related to how and when you use the third-party service, and an
  authorization token if it requires a login.
</p>
<p>
  We also exchange certain information with Luxottica Group S.p.A. (“Luxottica”), the manufacturer and distributor of
  the AI Glasses. We exchange information with Luxottica to fulfill our contractual obligations to Luxottica and to
  manage your customer service requests. For example, Luxottica shares with us your name, email address and information
  if you contact them about an issue you are experiencing. Then we share with Luxottica information to help resolve the
  issue, such as steps to resolve a problem with your Meta account. We also share with Luxottica information about AI
  Glasses purchased through their own channels, such as when they are activated, and we exchange aggregated information
  and insights with Luxottica relating to marketing, usage, sales, and post-sale activities. Luxottica does not collect
  any information directly from your use of the AI Glasses and/or the Meta AI App such as your photos and/or videos. Any

</p>
<p>IV. How do we process information when you use our voice services for Meta Wearable Products?</p>
<p>
  This Section applies when you use our voice services, like voice controls or the Meta AI service on AI Glasses. The
  voice services available to you depend on the version of your AI Glasses and your location.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      When you use our voice services, we record and process information about your voice interactions to respond to
      your requests. Voice interactions are things you say when using our voice services, including when voice services
      are invoked by mistake, as well as any background sound that can be heard once voice services are enabled. Voice
      interactions include both things you say when you use a wake-word (for example, if your AI Glasses are playing
      music, and you say “Hey Meta, pause the music”) and also when you don’t use a wake-word for certain interactions
      (saying “pause music”). The information we process for our voice services includes audio recordings and
      transcripts of your voice interactions, as well as data related to your voice interactions, like the hardware
      version of your AI Glasses and how long your interaction took.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      The Meta AI service on Ray-Ban | Meta AI glasses stores text transcripts and audio recordings of your voice
      interactions by default to help improve Meta’s products. This includes improving the Meta AI service (and related
      technologies), and training and improving our speech technologies. For example, audio recordings are used to help
      Meta’s products better understand and respond more accurately to a wide range of speech patterns and phrases over
      time. We use machine learning and trained reviewers to process this data to improve, troubleshoot, and train our
      products. We share that information with third party vendors and service providers to improve our products. You
      can access and delete recordings and related transcripts in the Meta AI App.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If you use voice controls on Ray-Ban Stories, we may store and process information about your voice interactions
      to improve our voice controls and other Meta products, depending on your preferences in Settings. This information
      can help our voice controls to better understand and respond more accurately to a wide range of speech patterns
      and phrases over time. You can manage voice storage to improve our voice controls and other Meta products in your
      Settings. When voice storage and processing for product improvement is turned on, we use machine learning and
      trained reviewers to process information about your voice interactions to improve, troubleshoot, and train our
      voice controls and other Meta products. We share that information with third party vendors and service providers
      to improve our products. Even with voice recording storage off, you can still use voice controls. You can access
      and delete stored voice information in your Settings.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      You can learn more about our voice services, including further details about what information we collect when you
      use our voice services and your choices over how we process that information, in the
