            the opportunity on Meta’s platforms to (1) access certain software tools (“<strong>Avatar Tools</strong>”)
            that can be used by you to assemble or generate digital representations of your virtual self for
            self-expression (each, a “<strong>Meta</strong><strong>Avatar</strong>”) and digital clothing, accessories,
            or assets for your Meta Avatar (“<strong>Generated Avatar Items</strong>” and together with Meta Avatars,
            “<strong>Generated Content</strong>”) and (2) purchase through Meta’s Avatars Store the right to access and
            use certain digital clothing, accessories, and other items distributed by Meta or its licensors (“<strong
              >Licensed</strong
            ><strong>Avatar Items</strong>”) (Generated Avatar Items and Licensed Avatar Items are collectively referred
            to herein as “<strong>Avatar Items</strong>”).

                <strong>Updates</strong>. We may update these Avatars Terms from time to time by notifying you of the
                updated Avatars Terms by any reasonable means, including by posting the updated Avatars Terms on our
                platform. Any changes to these Avatars Terms will not apply to any dispute between you and us arising

                following any changes to these Avatars Terms will constitute your acceptance of such changes. The “Last

                <strong>Accounts</strong>. You must have an active, personal Facebook, Instagram, Meta, or other
                Meta-supported account in order to access and use the Avatars Services. The account that is first used
                to generate or assemble Generated Content or to Acquire (as defined below) a Licensed Avatar Item is
                referred to as the “<strong>Controlling Account</strong>” for such Generated Content or Licensed Avatar
                Item, as applicable. In order to access or use such Generated Content or Licensed Avatar Item on any
                additional account, you must connect the additional account to the Controlling Account via the
                <a href="https://www.meta.com/help/accounts-center/Information-used-across-accounts/">Account Center</a>
                (each additional account once connected, a “<strong>Connected Account</strong>”). If you delete a
                Controlling Account or such Controlling Account is otherwise suspended or disabled, your Avatar and
                other Generated Content associated with such Controlling Account may still be accessible via the
                Connected Account(s); however, any Licensed Avatar Items associated with such Controlling Account will
                be deleted and will no longer be accessible via any Connected Account(s). You will not receive a refund
                for any Licensed Avatar Items that are no longer accessible due to the suspension, disabling or deletion
                of the Controlling Account associated with such Licensed Avatar Items in accordance with this Section 2.

              <p>
                Business accounts may be permitted by Meta to Acquire, at no charge, certain Licensed Avatar Items
                designated by Meta for such accounts and made available by Meta in the Avatars Services. Licensed Avatar
                Items Purchased in connection with a personal Controlling Account may not be accessed or used in
                connection with any business account. You acknowledge that if you convert your personal account to a
                business account, any Licensed Avatar Items associated with your personal account may no longer be
                accessible and you will not be entitled to a refund in connection with such Licensed Avatar Items. If
                you delete a business account or such account is otherwise suspended or disabled, any Licensed Avatar
                Items associated with such business account will be deleted and will no longer be accessible. You will
                not receive a refund for any Licensed Avatar Items that are no longer accessible due to the suspension,
                disabling or deletion of the business account associated with such Licensed Avatar Items.

                        As part of the Avatars Services, Meta may offer you access to Avatar Tools that can be used to
                        assemble or generate a Meta Avatar or Generated Avatar Items. For example, Avatar Tools may
                        include (A) tools that allow you to assemble an Avatar by selecting from a collection of
                        pre-determined attributes made available by Meta; (B) tools that enable us to create an Avatar
                        for you based on a selfie video recording or photo of yourself submitted by you (e.g.,
                        <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/276796764805785?helpref=faq_content">AutoGen</a>), or
                        based on one or more of your public profile photos on Meta Company Products (e.g.,
                        <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/622616883312812">Instant Avatar</a>s); and (C) tools that
                        enable us to create Generated Avatar Items based on text prompts or descriptions submitted by
                        you. Certain Avatars Services, including certain Avatar Tools, may not be available in all
                        locations.

                        If, in connection with your use of the Avatar Tools, you provide us with access to, or otherwise
                        make available to us, any images, videos, or other content, including any selfie video
                        recordings or photos or any profile photos (“<strong>User Content</strong>”), you hereby grant
                        to Meta a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable (through multiple tiers), royalty-free,
                        fully paid-up, worldwide license to reproduce, distribute, modify, create derivative works based
                        upon, perform and display (publicly or otherwise), and otherwise use such User Content and your
                        image, likeness and other personal characteristics as captured or reflected therein (your
                        “<strong>Persona</strong>”) in connection with Generated Content and the Avatars Services,
                        including the marketing and promotion thereof (consistent with your privacy and application
                        settings). This license will end when your User Content is deleted from our systems.

                      <p>
                        You hereby acknowledge and agree that, even if a Meta Avatar is generated from your User
                        Content, such Meta Avatar may nevertheless have similarities to other Avatars, and that Meta has
                        no responsibility or liability for any similarities between or among Avatars, and that you will
                        not object to, and will have no right to prevent, other Avatars Services users from having such
                        Avatars. Further, you hereby acknowledge that any Meta Avatar generated from your User Content

                        Services may create or generate a Meta Avatar or Generated Avatar Item with an identical or
                        similar combination of assets and features as those used by you for your Meta Avatar or
                        Generated Avatar Items, and (B) you will not object to, and have no right to prevent, other
                        Avatars Services users from having such Meta Avatars or Generated Avatar Items.

                    permitted by Meta to use the Avatars Services, by assembling or generating a Meta Avatar or
                    Generated Avatar Items using an Avatar Tool, Meta grants to you a limited, non-exclusive, revocable,
                    non-transferable, non-sublicensable right to access and use such Meta Avatar or Generated Avatar
                    Items solely for your personal, non-commercial use (except as expressly set forth in the “Limited
                    Commercial Use” section below). If you materially or repeatedly fail to comply with these Avatars
                    Terms, the right granted to you herein shall immediately terminate and you shall cease all use of
                    the Avatars Services, including any Meta Avatar and Generated Avatar Items.

                    Additional Caveats. Meta does not guarantee that any Avatar Tool or Generated Content will be made
                    available or, if made available, will remain available. Meta may, at any time, remove any Avatar
                    Tool or Generated Content from any Meta Company Product or change, supplement, impose additional
                    restrictions or limits on, suspend, delete, or discontinue any Avatar Tool or Generated Content for
                    any reason.

                  Licensed Avatar Items Listings. The Avatars Store may make available listings, descriptions, and

                  any listing, description, or image of a Licensed Avatar Item does not imply our endorsement of, or
                  affiliation with, any third-party licensor(s) associated with such Licensed Avatar Item. We make no
                  representations as to the completeness, accuracy, reliability, validity, or timeliness of such
                  listings, descriptions, or images (including any features, specifications, and prices contained

                  are approximate and are for convenience only. The colors of Avatar Items may vary depending on the
                  device on which you are viewing such items, and we cannot guarantee that a device will accurately
                  display such colors. It is your responsibility to ascertain and obey all applicable local, state,
                  federal, and foreign laws (including minimum age requirements) regarding the purchase, possession, and
                  use of any Licensed Avatar Item.

                  Acquisitions of Licensed Avatar Items are not redeemable or subject to refund by Meta and cannot be
                  traded for money or other items of value. To the extent that you engage in an Acquisition via a

                  such provider (and not with us) if you seek a refund in connection with such Acquisition.

                <strong>Limitation of Liability</strong>.<strong></strong>We cannot predict when issues might arise with
                the Services. Accordingly, our liability shall be limited to the fullest extent permitted by applicable
                law, and, subject to this limitation, under no circumstance will we be liable to you for any lost
                profits, revenues, information, or data, or consequential, special, indirect, exemplary, punitive, or
                incidental damages arising out of or related to these Avatars Terms or the Avatars Services, even if we
                have been advised of the possibility of such damages.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our aggregate liability arising out of or relating to these Avatars Terms, the Avatars Services
                (including any Meta Avatar or Avatar Items), or any Third-Party Services will not exceed the greater of:
                (a) the amount you have actually paid to us in connection with the Avatars Services in the twelve (12)
                months preceding the date on which the claim arose; and (b) one-hundred U.S. dollars ($100). THE LAWS OF
                SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE DISCLAIMER OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR CERTAIN TYPES OF DAMAGES, SO
                SOME OR ALL OF THE DISCLAIMERS AND LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY IN THIS SECTION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

                <strong>Dispute Resolution</strong>. PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT MAY
                SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT. THIS “DISPUTE
                RESOLUTION” SECTION REQUIRES YOU TO SUBMIT TO BINDING ARBITRATION OF ANY AND ALL DISPUTES WITH US
                (EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED FOR BELOW) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THESE AVATARS TERMS OR THE AVATARS
                SERVICES, AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM US.
              </p>
              <p>
                Except as provided below, you and we agree that any cause of action, legal claim, or dispute between you
                and us arising out of or related to these Avatars Terms or the Avatars Services (including any Meta
                Avatar or Avatar Items) (“<strong>claim(s)</strong>”) must be resolved by arbitration on an individual
                basis. Class actions and class arbitrations are not permitted; you and we may bring a claim only on your
                or our own behalf and cannot seek relief that would affect other users or purchasers of the Avatars
                Services. If there is a final judicial determination that any claim (or a request for particular relief)
                cannot be arbitrated in accordance with the limitations of this “Dispute Resolution” section, then only
                that claim (or only that request for relief) may be brought in court. All other claims (or requests for
                relief) remain subject to this “Dispute Resolution” section.
              </p>
              <p>
                Instead of using arbitration, you or we can bring claims in your local “small claims” court, if the
                rules of that court will allow it. If you don’t bring your claims in small claims court (or if you or we
                appeal a small claims court judgment to a court of general jurisdiction), then the claims must be
                resolved by binding, individual arbitration. The American Arbitration Association
                (“<strong>AAA</strong>”) will administer all arbitrations under its Consumer Arbitration Rules, as
                amended by these Avatars Terms. YOU AND WE EXPRESSLY WAIVE THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY.
              </p>
              <p>
                The arbitrator will conduct hearings, if any, by teleconference or videoconference, rather than by
                personal appearances, unless the arbitrator determines upon request by you or by us that an in-person
                hearing is appropriate. Any in-person appearances will be held at a location which is reasonably
                convenient to both parties with due consideration of their ability to travel and other pertinent
                circumstances. If the parties are unable to agree on a location, such determination shall be made by the
                AAA or by the arbitrator. The arbitrator’s decision will be final and binding. The arbitrator will have
                authority to award temporary, interim, or permanent injunctive relief or relief providing for specific
                performance but only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the individual claim before
                the arbitrator. The award rendered by the arbitrator may be confirmed and enforced in any court having
                jurisdiction thereof. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, nothing in these Avatars Terms will preclude
                you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies and, if the law allows,
                they can seek relief against us for you. In addition, disputes relating to the scope and enforceability
                of the arbitration provision are for a court to decide.
              </p>
              <p>
                This arbitration provision is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act. You can opt out of this
                arbitration provision within thirty (30) days of the date that you first agreed to any version of these
                Avatars Terms. To opt out, you must send your name, residence address, email address, and a clear
                statement that you want to opt out of this arbitration provision here: Meta Platforms, Inc. ATTN:
                Arbitration Opt-out, 1601 Willow Road, Menlo Park, CA 94025.
              </p>
              <p>
                Before you commence arbitration of a claim, you must provide us with a written Notice of Dispute that
                includes your name, residence address, username, email address, a detailed description of the dispute,
                and the relief you seek. Any Notice of Dispute you send to us should be mailed to Meta Platforms, Inc.,
                ATTN: Arbitration Filing, 1601 Willow Road, Menlo Park, CA 94025. Before we commence arbitration, we
                will send you a Notice of Dispute to the email address you provided, or by other appropriate means. If
                we are unable to resolve a dispute within thirty (30) days after the Notice of Dispute is received, you
                or we may commence arbitration.
              </p>
              <p>
                We will pay all arbitration filing fees, administration and hearing costs, and arbitrator fees for any
                arbitration we bring or if your claims seek less than $75,000 and you timely provided us with a Notice
                of Dispute. For all other claims, the costs and fees of arbitration shall be allocated in accordance
                with the AAA’s applicable rules, including rules regarding frivolous or improper claims.
              </p>
              <p>
                For any claim that is not arbitrated or resolved in small claims court, you agree that it will be
                resolved exclusively in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California or a state court
                located in San Mateo County. You also agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of either of these
                courts for the purpose of litigating any such claim.
