                  governs our processing of personal information processed
                  through the AIs and explains how we collect, use, and share
                  personal information - including personal information you
                  submit as Prompts, Feedback, or other Content, your activity
                  across our products, and personal information we collect from
                  and about your device. We process personal information,
                  including information on sensitive topics, as described in the
                  Privacy Policy, to improve AIs and related technology.
                </p>
                <p>
                  When information is shared with AIs, the AIs may retain and
                  use that information to provide more personalized Outputs. Do
                  not share information that you don’t want the AIs to use and
                  retain such as account identifiers, passwords, financial
                  information, or other sensitive topics.

                <p>
                  If the AIs cannot answer your query, or if our systems
                  determine that a more relevant or up-to-date response could be
                  provided by a partner, we may ask a third party to provide a
                  response. For example, in these cases we share questions
                  contained in a Prompt and limited metadata to enable a more
                  accurate answer with a third-party search engine, and include
                  the search results in the response to your Prompt. The
                  information we share with third parties may contain personal
                  information if your Prompt contains personal information about
                  any person. By using AIs, you are instructing us to share your
                  information with third parties when it provides you with more
                  relevant or useful responses. Those third parties will use any
                  information we share – which could include personal
                  information about you or others if you include such
                  information in your Prompt– in accordance with those third
                  parties’ privacy policies. You can view the list of these
                  third parties, and links to their privacy policies, by

                  In some cases, Meta will review your interactions with AIs,
                  including the content of your conversations with or messages
                  to AIs, and this review can be automated or manual (human).

                  correction of your personal information, subject to certain
                  exceptions. To learn more about how you can access and delete

                <p>
                  AIs are a new technology that are still improving in accuracy.
                  As such the accuracy of any content, including outputs cannot
                  be guaranteed and that outputs may be disturbing or upsetting.
                  You should not rely upon outputs for any purpose or use
                  outputs to inform professional advice or decisions related to
                  medicine, finance, law or pharmaceuticals. If you plan to use
                  outputs for any reason, it is your sole responsibility to
                  verify outputs. AIs and any content may not reflect accurate,
                  complete or current information.

                <p>
                  The AIs will generate Content based on Prompts that you
                  provide. The specific Content that the AIs will return based
                  on your Prompts cannot be predicted in advance. AIs might
                  generate content that you consider offensive or objectionable
                  and/or that does not represent Meta’s views. By agreeing to
                  these terms and by using AIs, you recognize and assume the
                  risk that the prompts you provide might result in generation
                  of content that you consider offensive or objectionable. You
                  also recognize and agree that you – not Meta – are responsible
                  for your use of, and/or any actions you take in relation to,
                  content generated by the AIs based on your prompts.

                <p>
                  AIs are a new technology and are still improving. We make no
                  guarantees that they will be safe, secure or error-free, or
                  will function without disruptions, delays or imperfections. We
                  are not responsible for Outputs, and you are responsible for
                  checking Outputs for accuracy and suitability. The Outputs
                  provided by AIs do not reflect the views of Meta, our
                  affiliates or our personnel.

                <p>Limitations on Liability</p>
                <p>
                  Nothing in these Terms is intended to exclude or limit our
                  liability for death, personal injury or fraudulent
                  misrepresentation caused by our negligence, or to affect your
                  statutory rights.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We will exercise professional diligence in providing the AIs
                  to you in accordance with these Terms. Provided that we have
                  acted with such professional diligence, we do not accept
                  responsibility for losses not caused by our breach of these
                  Terms or otherwise by our acts; losses that are not reasonably
                  foreseeable by you and us at the time of entering into these
                  Terms; and events beyond our reasonable control.

            <strong>Disputes</strong>
            <p>
              If a claim or dispute arises out of or relates to your use of the
              Meta AIs as a consumer, both you and us agree that you may resolve
              your individual claim or dispute against us, and we may resolve
              our claim or dispute against you, in any competent court in the
              country of your main residence that has jurisdiction over your
              claim or dispute, and the laws of that country will apply without
              regard to conflict of law provisions.
            </p>
            <p>
              If a claim or dispute arises between us that relates to use of the
              Meta Products in any other capacity, including, but not limited
              to, access or use of the Meta AIs for a business or commercial
              purpose, or that an entity brings on your behalf, you agree that
              any such claim or dispute must be resolved exclusively in the U.S.
              District Court for the Northern District of California or a state
              court located in San Mateo County. You also agree to submit to the
              personal jurisdiction of either of these courts for the purpose of
              litigating any such claim, and that the laws of the State of
              California will govern these Terms and any such claim or dispute
              without regard to conflict of law provisions. Without prejudice to
              the foregoing, you agree that, in its sole discretion, Meta may
              bring any claim, cause of action, or dispute we have against you
              in such a capacity in any competent court in Brazil that has
              jurisdiction over the claim.

            <strong>Severability</strong>
            <p>
              If any portion of these Terms is found to be unenforceable, the
              unenforceable portion will be deemed amended to the minimum extent
              necessary to make it enforceable, and if it can’t be made
              enforceable, then it will be severed and the remaining portion
              will remain in full force and effect. If we fail to enforce any of
              these Terms, it will not be considered a waiver. Any amendment to
              or waiver of these Terms must be made in writing and signed by us.

            <strong>Changes to These Terms</strong>
            <p>
              We work constantly to improve our services and develop new
              features to make our products better for you and our community. As
              a result, we may need to update these Terms from time to time to
              accurately reflect our services and practices, to promote a safe
              and secure experience, and/or to comply with applicable law.
              Unless the changes are required to comply with legal obligations,
              we will notify you (for example through email or in-app
              notification) of any changes to these Terms and give you an
              opportunity to review them before they go into effect. Once any
              updated Terms are in effect you will be bound by them if you
              continue to use our AIs. If you do not agree to the updated Terms,
              you should stop using AIs before they go into effect.
