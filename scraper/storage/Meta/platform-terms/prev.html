<h2>3. Data Use</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <br /><b>a. Prohibited Practices.</b> You will not perform, or facilitate or
    support others in performing, any of the following prohibited practices

    <ul>
      <li>
        <br />
        i. Processing Platform Data to discriminate or encourage discrimination
        in a manner that disadvantages people based on personal attributes
        including race, ethnicity, color, national origin, religion, age, sex,
        sexual orientation, gender identity, family status, disability, medical
        or genetic condition, or any other categories prohibited by applicable
        law, regulation, or Meta policy. Using Platform Data such as gender or

        under this Section 3.a.i so long as it is compliant with applicable law
        or regulation.

        ii. Processing Platform Data to make eligibility determinations about
        people, including for housing, employment, insurance, education
        opportunities, credit, government benefits, or immigration status. By
        eligibility determinations, we mean determining whether to provide,
        deny, or take away a particular benefit (for example, housing or
        scholarships) as well as determining the terms under which the benefit
        will be provided, denied, or taken away.
      </li>
      <li>
        <br />
        iii. Processing Platform Data to perform, facilitate, or provide tools

        about people, places, groups, or events for law enforcement or national
        security purposes.

      <li>
        <br />
        vi. Attempting to decode, circumvent, re-identify, de-anonymize,
        unscramble, unencrypt, or reverse hash, or reverse-engineer Platform
        Data that is provided to you.
      </li>
      <li>
        <br />
        vii. Changing your App’s core functionality or data Processing so that

        changing the scope of Processing of previously collected Platform Data,
        unless in each case you first re-submit your App and receive our
        approval through App Review.
      </li>
      <li>
        <br />
        viii. Processing Platform Data for purposes other than the applicable

      <li>
        <br />
