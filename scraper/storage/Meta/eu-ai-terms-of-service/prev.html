          <p>A. Rights to Content</p>
          <p>
            AIs allows you to provide materials for processing, which could include text, documents, images, or
            recordings, depending on the integration (together, “Prompts”) and will generate a response (“Outputs”)
            based on your Prompts, as well as any feedback you provide (“Feedback”) collectively, “Content”. You may not
            provide prompts or use AIs in any way that infringes or violates someone else’s rights, including
            intellectual property rights. Except as expressly provided in these Terms, you retain all right, title, and
            interest – including any intellectual property rights – that you have in and to your Prompts. You agree that
            your provision of Prompts will not violate these Terms, including the Acceptable Uses, and other policies
            that apply to your use of AIs.
          </p>
          <p>B. Meta AIs Data</p>
          <p>
            The <a href="https://www.facebook.com/privacy/policy/">Meta Privacy Policy</a> governs our processing of
            personal information processed through the AIs and explains how we collect, use, and share personal
            information - including personal information you submit as Prompts, Feedback, or other Content, your
            activity across our products, and personal information we collect from and about your device. We process
            personal information, as described in the Privacy Policy, to provide the service to you.
          </p>
          <p>
            When information is shared with AIs, the AIs may retain and use that information to provide more
            personalized Outputs. Do not share information that you don’t want the AIs to use and retain such as account
            identifiers, passwords, financial information, or other sensitive topics.
          </p>
          <p>
            If the AIs cannot answer your query, or if our systems determine that a more relevant or up-to-date response
            could be provided by a partner, we may ask a third party to provide a response. For example, in these cases
            we share questions contained in a Prompt and limited metadata to enable a more accurate answer with a
            third-party search engine, and include the search results in the response to your Prompt. The information we
            share with third parties may contain personal information if your Prompt contains personal information about
            any person. By using AIs, you are instructing us to share your information with third parties when it
            provides you with more relevant or useful responses. Those third parties will use any information we share –
            which could include personal information about you or others if you include such information in your Prompt–
            in accordance with those third parties’ privacy policies. You can view the list of these third parties, and
            links to their privacy policies, by visiting our
            <a href="https://www.facebook.com/privacy/dialog/ai-partners"> Privacy Center</a>. We add or remove third
            parties from time to time, and notice will be provided solely by adding or removing that party from the list
            referenced above.
          </p>
          <p>
            In some cases, Meta will review your interactions with AIs, including the content of your conversations with
            or messages to AIs, and this review can be automated or manual (human).
          </p>
          <p>
            Depending on where you reside, you or an authorized agent may request access to your personal information
            from Meta in a portable format, deletion of your personal information, or correction of your personal
            information, subject to certain exceptions. To learn more about how you can access and delete your personal
            information associated with AIs, and exercise any applicable rights, visit our
            <a href="https://www.facebook.com/privacy/guide/genai?entry_point=whatsapp_genai"> Privacy Center</a>. It is
            important that you review the Privacy Center before you try to delete any personal information or delete or
            deactivate your account. Depending on how you use AIs, deleting individual messages, entire threads, or even
            your account may not delete our copy of your personal information, and the Privacy Center describes the
            correct way to delete your personal information.
          </p>
          <p>C. Accuracy</p>
          <p>
            AIs are a new technology that are still improving in accuracy. As such the accuracy of any content,
            including outputs cannot be guaranteed and that outputs may be disturbing or upsetting. You should not rely
            upon outputs for any purpose or use outputs to inform professional advice or decisions related to medicine,
            finance, law or pharmaceuticals. If you plan to use outputs for any reason, it is your sole responsibility
            to verify outputs. AIs and any content may not reflect accurate, complete or current information.
          </p>
          <p>D. Warning Regarding Content</p>
          <p>
            The AIs will generate Content based on Prompts that you provide. The specific Content that the AIs will
            return based on your Prompts cannot be predicted in advance. AIs might generate content that you consider
            offensive or objectionable and/or that does not represent Meta’s views. By agreeing to these terms and by
            using ais, you recognize and assume the risk that the prompts you provide might result in generation of
            content that you consider offensive or objectionable. you also recognize and agree that you – not Meta – are
            responsible for your use of, and/or any actions you take in relation to, content generated by the ais based
            on your prompts.

          <p>A. Meta’s Rights Regarding Content</p>
          <p>

              authority
            </li>
            <li>

            </li>
            <li>To suspend or remove accounts that violate these Terms with respect to your use of AIs</li>
          </ul>
          <p>B. Suspension and Termination</p>
          <p>

            permanently disable your access to AIs or other Meta services or features, and we may permanently disable or
            delete your account including where we are required to do so for legal reasons.

          >
          <p>
            We retain all our respective rights, title, and interest, including intellectual property rights, in and to
            AIs. Other than the rights of access and use expressly granted in these Terms, these Terms do not grant you
            any right, title, or interest in or to the AIs.

            AIs may use or be used in connection with content, services, features, and integrations provided by third
            parties. Meta is not responsible for your use of third-party content, services, features, and integrations,

            error-free, or will function without disruptions, delays or imperfections. We are not responsible for
            Outputs, and you are responsible for checking Outputs for accuracy and suitability. The Outputs provided by
            AIs do not reflect the views of Meta, our affiliates or our personnel.

          <p>
            Nothing in these Terms is intended to exclude or limit our liability for death, personal injury or
            fraudulent misrepresentation caused by our negligence, or to affect your statutory rights.
