        <h1>Overview</h1>
        <p>Effective January 1, 2025</p>
        <p>
          Meta builds technologies and services that enable people to connect
          with each other, build communities, and grow businesses. These Terms
          of Service (the "Terms") govern your access and use of Facebook,
          Messenger, and the other products, websites, features, apps, services,
          technologies, and software we offer (the
          <a
            href="https://www.facebook.com/help/1561485474074139"
            target="_blank"
            >Meta Products</a
          >
          or Products), except where we expressly state that separate terms (and
          not these) apply. (For example, your use of Instagram is subject to
          the Instagram Terms of Use). These Products are provided to you by
          Meta Platforms, Inc. These Terms therefore constitute an agreement
          between you and Meta Platforms, Inc. If you do not agree to these
          Terms, then do not access or use Facebook or the other products and
          services covered by these Terms.
        </p>
        <p>
          These Terms (formerly known as the Statement of Rights and
          Responsibilities) make up the entire agreement between you and Meta
          Platforms, Inc. regarding your use of our Products. They supersede any
          prior agreements.
        </p>
        <p>
          We don’t charge you to use Facebook or the other products and services
          covered by these Terms, unless we state otherwise. Instead, businesses
          and organizations, and other persons pay us to show you ads for their
          products and services. By using our Products, you agree that we can
          show you ads that we think may be relevant to you and your interests.
          We use your personal data to help determine which personalized ads to
          show you.
        </p>
        <p>
          We don’t sell your personal data to advertisers, and we don’t share
          information that directly identifies you (such as your name, email
          address or other contact information) with advertisers unless you give
          us specific permission. Instead, advertisers can tell us things like
          the kind of audience they want to see their ads, and we show those ads
          to people who may be interested. We provide advertisers with reports
          about the performance of their ads that help them understand how
          people are interacting with their content. See Section 2 below to
          learn more about how personalized advertising under these terms works
          on the Meta Products.

            >Privacy Policy</a
          >
          explains how we collect and use your personal data to determine some
          of the ads you see and provide all of the other services described
          below. You can also go to your

          choices you have about how we use your data.

        <h1>1. The services we provide</h1>
        <p>
          Our mission is to give people the power to build community and bring
          the world closer together. To help advance this mission, we provide
          the Products and services described below to you:
        </p>
        <h2>1.1 Provide a personalized experience for you:</h2>
        <p>
          Your experience on Facebook is unlike anyone else's: from the posts,
          stories, events, ads, and other content you see in Facebook Feed or
          our video platform to the Facebook Pages you follow and other features
          you might use, such as Facebook Marketplace, and search. For example,
          we use data about the connections you make, the choices and settings
          you select, and what you share and do on and off our Products - to
          personalize your experience.
        </p>
        <h2>1.2 Connect you with people and organizations you care about:</h2>
        <p>
          We help you find and connect with people, groups, businesses,
          organizations, and others that matter to you across the Meta Products
          you use. We use data to make suggestions for you and others - for
          example, groups to join, events to attend, Facebook Pages to follow or
          send a message to, shows to watch, and people you may want to become
          friends with. Stronger ties make for better communities, and we
          believe our services are most useful when people are connected to
          people, groups, and organizations they care about.
        </p>
        <h2>
          1.3 Empower you to express yourself and communicate about what matters
          to you:
        </h2>
        <p>
          There are many ways to express yourself on Facebook to communicate
          with friends, family, and others about what matters to you - for
          example, sharing status updates, photos, videos, and stories across
          the Meta Products (consistent with your settings), sending messages or
          making voice or video calls to a friend or several people, creating
          events or groups, or adding content to your profile as well as showing
          you insights on how others engage with your content. We have also
          developed, and continue to explore, new ways for people to use
          technology, such as augmented reality and 360 video to create and
          share more expressive and engaging content on Meta Products.
        </p>
        <h2>
          1.4 Help you discover content, products, and services that may
          interest you:
        </h2>
        <p>
          We show you personalized ads, offers, and other sponsored or
          commercial content to help you discover content, products, and
          services that are offered by the many businesses and organizations
          that use Facebook and other Meta Products. Section 2 below explains
          this in more detail.
        </p>
        <h2>
          1.5 Promote the safety, security, and integrity of our services,
          combat harmful conduct and keep our community of users safe:
        </h2>
        <p>
          People will only build community on Meta Products if they feel safe
          and secure. We work hard to maintain the security (including the
          availability, authenticity, integrity, and confidentiality) of our
          Products and services. We employ dedicated teams around the world,
          work with external service providers, partners and other relevant
          entities and develop advanced technical systems to detect potential
          misuse of our Products, harmful conduct towards others, and situations
          where we may be able to help support or protect our community,
          including to respond to user reports of potentially violating content.
          If we learn of content or conduct like this, we may take appropriate
          action based on our assessment that may include - notifying you,
          offering help, removing content, removing or restricting access to
          certain features, disabling an account, or contacting law enforcement.
          We share data across
          <a
            href="https://www.facebook.com/help/111814505650678?ref=tos"
            target="_blank"
            >Meta Companies</a
          >
          when we detect misuse or harmful conduct by someone using one of our
          Products or to help keep Meta Products, users and the community safe.
          For example, we share information with Meta Companies that provide
          financial products and services to help them promote safety, security
          and integrity and comply with applicable law. Meta may access,
          preserve, use and share any information it collects about you where it
          has a good faith belief it is required or permitted by law to do so.

          <a href="https://www.facebook.com/privacy/policy" target="_blank"

        </p>
        <p>
          In some cases, the Oversight Board may review our decisions, subject
          to its terms and bylaws. Learn more

        <h2>
          1.6 Use and develop advanced technologies to provide safe and
          functional services for everyone:
        </h2>
        <p>
          We use and develop advanced technologies - such as artificial
          intelligence, machine learning systems, and augmented reality - so
          that people can use our Products safely regardless of physical ability
          or geographic location. For example, technology like this helps people
          who have visual impairments understand what or who is in photos or
          videos shared on Facebook or Instagram. We also build sophisticated
          network and communication technology to help more people connect to
          the internet in areas with limited access. And we develop automated
          systems to improve our ability to detect and remove abusive and
          dangerous activity that may harm our community and the integrity of
          our Products.
        </p>
        <h2>1.7 Research ways to make our services better:</h2>
        <p>
          We engage in research to develop, test, and improve our Products. This
          includes analyzing data we have about our users and understanding how
          people use our Products, for example by conducting surveys and testing
          and troubleshooting new features. Our
          <a href="https://www.facebook.com/privacy/policy" target="_blank"
            >Privacy Policy</a
          >
          explains how we use data to support this research for the purposes of
          developing and improving our services.
        </p>
        <h2>
          1.8 Provide consistent and seamless experiences across the Meta
          Company Products:
        </h2>
        <p>
          Our Products help you find and connect with people, groups,
          businesses, organizations, and others that are important to you. We
          design our systems so that your experience is consistent and seamless
          across the different
          <a
            href="https://www.facebook.com/help/195227921252400?ref=tos"
            target="_blank"
            >Meta Company Products</a
          >
          that you use. For example, we use data about the people you engage
          with on Facebook to make it easier for you to connect with them on
          Instagram or Messenger, and we enable you to communicate with a
          business you follow on Facebook through Messenger.
        </p>
        <h2>1.9 Ensuring access to our services:</h2>
        <p>
          To operate our global services and enable you to connect with people
          around the world, we need to transfer, store and distribute content
          and data to our data centers, partners, service providers, vendors and
          systems around the world, including outside your country of residence.
          The use of this global infrastructure is necessary and essential to
          provide our services. This infrastructure may be owned, operated, or
          controlled by Meta Platforms, Inc., Meta Platforms Ireland Limited, or
          its affiliates.

        <h1>2. How our services are funded</h1>
        <p>
          Instead of paying to use Facebook and the other products and services
          we offer, by using the Meta Products covered by these Terms, you agree
          that we can show you personalized ads and other commercial and
          sponsored content that businesses and organizations pay us to promote
          on and off
          <a
            href="https://www.facebook.com/help/195227921252400?ref=tos"
            target="_blank"
            >Meta Company Products</a
          >. We use your personal data, such as information about your activity
          and interests, to show you personalized ads and sponsored content that
          may be more relevant to you.
        </p>
        <p>
          Protecting people's privacy is central to how we've designed our
          personalized ads system. This means that we can show you relevant and
          useful ads without telling advertisers who you are. We don't sell your
          personal data. We allow advertisers to tell us things like their
          business goal, and the kind of audience they want to see their ads
          (for example, people between the age of 18-35 who like cycling). We
          then show their ad to people who we think might be interested.
        </p>
        <p>
          We also provide advertisers with reports about the performance of
          their ads to help them understand how people are interacting with
          their content on and off Meta Products. For example, we provide
          general demographic and interest information to advertisers to help
          them better understand their audience, like the fact that women
          between the ages of 25 and 34 who live in Madrid and like software
          engineering have seen an ad. We don’t share information that directly
          identifies you (information such as your name or email address that by
          itself can be used to contact you or identifies who you are) unless
          you give us specific permission. Learn more about how Meta ads work
          <a href="https://www.facebook.com/about/ads" target="_blank">here</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          We collect and use your personal data in order to provide the services
          described above to you. You can learn about how we collect and use
          your data in our
          <a href="https://www.facebook.com/privacy/policy" target="_blank"
            >Privacy Policy</a

          and the types of information we use to determine which ads we show
          you.

        <h1>3. Your commitments to Facebook and our community</h1>
        <p>
          We provide these services to you and others to help advance our
          mission. In exchange, we need you to make the following commitments:
        </p>
        <h2>3.1 Who can use Facebook</h2>
        <p>
          When people stand behind their opinions and actions, our community is
          safer and more accountable. For this reason, you must:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Provide for your account the same name that you use in everyday
            life.
          </li>
          <li>Provide accurate information about yourself.</li>
          <li>
            Create only one account (your own) and use it for personal purposes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Not share your password, give access to your Facebook account to
            others, or transfer your account to anyone else (without our
            permission).
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          We try to make Facebook broadly available to everyone, but you cannot
          use Facebook if:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>You are under 13 years old.</li>
          <li>You are a convicted sex offender.</li>
          <li>
            We've previously disabled your account for violations of our Terms,
            the
            <a
              href="https://transparency.meta.com/policies/community-standards/"
              target="_blank"
              >Community Standards</a
            >, or other terms and policies that apply to your use of Facebook.
            If we disable your account for a violation of our Terms, the
            <a
              href="https://transparency.meta.com/policies/community-standards/"
              target="_blank"
              >Community Standards</a
            >, or other terms and policies, you agree not to create another
            account without our permission. Receiving permission to create a new
            account is provided at our sole discretion, and does not mean or
            imply that the disciplinary action was wrong or without cause.
          </li>
          <li>
            You are prohibited from receiving our products, services, or
            software under applicable laws.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>3.2 What you can share and do on Meta Products</h2>
        <p>
          We want people to use Meta Products to express themselves and to share
          content that is important to them, but not at the expense of the
          safety and well-being of others or the integrity of our community. You
          therefore agree not to engage in the conduct described below (or to
          facilitate or support others in doing so):
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            You may not use our Products to do or share anything:
            <ul>
              <li>
                That violates these Terms, the

                >, or <a href="#section_5">other terms and policies</a> that
                apply to your use of our Products.
              </li>
              <li>
                That is unlawful, misleading, discriminatory or fraudulent (or
                assists someone else in using our Products in such a way).
              </li>
              <li>
                That you do not own or have the necessary rights to share.
              </li>
              <li>
                That infringes or violates someone else's rights, including
                their intellectual property rights (such as by infringing
                another’s copyright or trademark, or distributing or selling
                counterfeit or pirated goods), unless an exception or limitation
                applies under applicable law.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            You may not upload viruses or malicious code, use the services to
            send spam, or do anything else that could disable, overburden,
            interfere with, or impair the proper working, integrity, operation,
            or appearance of our services, systems, or Products.
          </li>
          <li>
            You may not access or collect data from our Products using automated
            means (without our prior permission) or attempt to access data you
            do not have permission to access, regardless of whether such
            automated access or collection is undertaken while logged-in to a
            Facebook account.
          </li>
          <li>
            You may not proxy, request, or collect Product usernames or
            passwords, or misappropriate access tokens.
          </li>
          <li>
            Except as provided in the

            >, you may not sell, license, or purchase any data obtained from us
            or our services, regardless of whether such data was obtained while

          community of users; compromise or interfere with the integrity or

          We work with independent fact-checkers in many jurisdictions to combat

        </p>
        <h2>3.3 The permissions you give us</h2>
        <p>We need certain permissions from you to provide our services:</p>
        <p>
          <b>1. Your content:</b> Some content that you share or upload, such as
          photos or videos, may be protected by intellectual property laws.
        </p>
        <p>
          You retain ownership of the intellectual property rights (things like
          copyright or trademarks) in any such content that you create and share
          on Facebook and other
          <a
            href="https://www.facebook.com/help/195227921252400?ref=tos"
            target="_blank"
            >Meta Company Products</a
          >
          you use. Nothing in these Terms takes away the rights you have to your
          own content. You are free to share your content with anyone else,
          wherever you want.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, to provide our services we need you to give us some legal
          permissions (known as a "license") to use this content. This is solely
          for the purposes of providing and improving our Products and services
          as described in Section 1 above.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>2. Permission to use content you create and share:</b>
          Specifically, when you share, post, or upload content that is covered
          by intellectual property rights on or in connection with our Products,
          you grant us a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable,
          royalty-free, and worldwide license to host, use, distribute, modify,
          run, copy, publicly perform or display, translate, and create
          derivative works of your content (consistent with your
          <a
            href="https://www.facebook.com/help/325807937506242?ref=tos"
            target="_blank"

          and
          <a

            target="_blank"
            >application</a
          >
          settings). This means, for example, that if you share a photo on
          Facebook, you give us permission to store, copy, and share it with
          others (again, consistent with your settings) such as Meta Products or
          service providers that support those products and services. This
          license will end when your content is deleted from our systems.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>3. Deleting Your Content:</b> You can delete individual content you
          share, post, and upload at any time. In addition, all content posted
          to your personal account will be deleted if you delete your account.
          <a

            >Learn more</a
          >
          about how to delete your account. Account deletion does not
          automatically delete content that you post as an admin of a page or
          content that you create collectively with other users, such as photos
          in Shared Albums which may continue to be visible to other album
          members.
        </p>
        <p>
          It may take up to 90 days to delete content after we begin the account
          deletion process or receive a content deletion request. If you send
          content to trash, the deletion process will automatically begin in 30
          days unless you chose to delete the content sooner. While the deletion
          process for such content is being undertaken, the content is no longer
          visible to other users. After the content is deleted, it may take us
          up to another 90 days to remove it from backups and disaster recovery
          systems.
        </p>
        <p>
          Content will not be deleted within 90 days of the account deletion or
          content deletion process beginning in the following situations:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            where your content has been used by others in accordance with this
            license and they have not deleted it (in which case this license
            will continue to apply until that content is deleted);
          </li>
          <li>
            where deletion within 90 days is not possible due to technical
            limitations of our systems, in which case, we will complete the
            deletion as soon as technically feasible; or
          </li>
          <li>
            where immediate deletion would restrict our ability to:
            <ul>
              <li>
                investigate or identify illegal activity or violations of our
                terms and policies (for example, to identify or investigate
                misuse of our Products or systems);
              </li>
              <li>
                protect the safety, integrity, and security of our Products,
                systems, services, our employees, and users, and to defend
                ourselves;
              </li>
              <li>
                comply with legal obligations for the preservation of evidence,
                including data Meta Companies providing financial products and
                services preserve to comply with any record keeping obligations
                required by law; or
              </li>
              <li>
                comply with a request of a judicial or administrative authority,
                law enforcement or a government agency;
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          in which case, the content will be retained for no longer than is
          necessary for the purposes for which it has been retained (the exact
          duration will vary on a case-by-case basis).
        </p>
        <p>
          In each of the above cases, this license will continue until the
          content has been fully deleted.

          advertised event or have liked a Facebook Page created by a brand that
          has paid us to display its ads on Facebook. Ads and content like this

        <h1>4. Additional provisions</h1>
        <h2>4.1 Updating our Terms</h2>
        <p>
          We work constantly to improve our services and develop new features to
          make our Products better for you and our community. As a result, we
          may need to update these Terms from time to time to accurately reflect
          our services and practices, to promote a safe and secure experience on
          our Products and services, and/or to comply with applicable law.
          Unless otherwise required by law, we will notify you before we make
          changes to these Terms and give you an opportunity to review them
          before they go into effect. Once any updated Terms are in effect, you
          will be bound by them if you continue to access or use our Products.
        </p>
        <p>
          We hope that you will continue using our Products, but if you do not
          agree to our updated Terms or wish to terminate your agreement to this
          contract, you can

          your account at any time and you must also stop accessing, or using
          Facebook and the other Meta Products.
        </p>
        <h2>4.2 Account suspension or termination</h2>
        <p>
          We want Facebook to be a place where people feel welcome and safe to
          express themselves and share their thoughts and ideas. If we
          determine, in our discretion, that you have clearly, seriously or
          repeatedly breached our Terms or Policies, including in particular the
          <a href="https://www.facebook.com/communitystandards" target="_blank"
            >Community Standards</a
          >, we may suspend or permanently disable your access to Meta Company
          Products, and we may permanently disable or delete your account. We
          may also disable or delete your account if you repeatedly infringe
          other people’s intellectual property rights or where we are required
          to do so for legal reasons.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may disable or delete your account if after registration your
          account is not confirmed, your account is unused and remains inactive
          for an extended period of time, or if we detect someone may have used
          it without your permission and we are unable to confirm your ownership
          of the account.

          you have to request a review, unless doing so may expose us or others

          If you delete or we disable or delete your account, and you stop
          accessing, using, or visiting Facebook and the other Meta Products, or
          if this contract is otherwise terminated, then these Terms shall
          terminate as an agreement between you and us, except for the following
          provisions, which will remain in place: (3, 4.2-4.5).
        </p>
        <h2>4.3 Limits on liability</h2>
        <p>
          We work hard to provide the best Products we can and to specify clear
          guidelines for everyone who uses them. Our Products, however, are
          provided "as is," and we make no guarantees that they always will be
          safe, secure, or error-free, or that they will function without
          disruptions, delays, or imperfections. To the extent permitted by law,
          we also DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING
          THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
          PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. We do not control or direct what
          people and others do or say, and we are not responsible for their
          actions or conduct (whether online or offline) or any content they
          share (including offensive, inappropriate, obscene, unlawful, and
          other objectionable content).
        </p>
        <p>
          We cannot predict when issues might arise with our Products.
          Accordingly, our liability shall be limited to the fullest extent
          permitted by applicable law, and under no circumstance will we be
          liable to you for any lost profits, revenues, information, or data, or
          consequential, special, indirect, exemplary, punitive, or incidental
          damages arising out of or related to these Terms or the Meta Products
          (however caused and on any theory of liability, including negligence),
          even if we have been advised of the possibility of such damages. Our
          aggregate liability arising out of or relating to these Terms or the
          Meta Products will not exceed the greater of $100 or the amount you
          have paid us in the past twelve months.
        </p>
        <h2>4.4 Disputes</h2>
        <p>
          We try to provide clear rules so that we can limit or hopefully avoid
          disputes between you and us. If a dispute does arise, however, it's
          useful to know up front where it can be resolved and what laws will
          apply.
        </p>
        <p>
          You and Meta each agree that any claim, cause of action, or dispute
          between us that arises out of or relates to these Terms or your access
          or use of the Meta Products shall be resolved exclusively in the U.S.
          District Court for the Northern District of California or a state
          court located in San Mateo County. You also agree to submit to the
          personal jurisdiction of either of these courts for the purpose of
          litigating any such claim, and that the laws of the State of
          California will govern these Terms and any claim, cause of action, or
          dispute without regard to conflict of law provisions. Without
          prejudice to the foregoing, you agree that, in its sole discretion,
          Meta may bring any claim, cause of action, or dispute we have against
          you in any competent court in the country in which you reside that has
          jurisdiction over the claim.

          <li>
            <b>Supplemental Terms:</b> Some of the Products we offer are also
            governed by supplemental terms. If you use any of those Products,
            supplemental terms will be made available and will become part of
            our agreement with you. For instance, if you access or use our
            Products for commercial or business purposes, such as buying ads,
            selling products, developing apps, managing a group or Page for your
            business, or using our measurement services, you must agree to our

            <b>Severability:</b> If any portion of these Terms is found to be
            unenforceable, the unenforceable portion will be deemed amended to

            portion will remain in full force and effect. If we fail to enforce
            any of these Terms, it will not be considered a waiver. Any
            amendment to or waiver of these Terms must be made in writing and
            signed by us.
