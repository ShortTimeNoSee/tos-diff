<h1>Private Content</h1>

<h3>
  Overview<br />
   
</h3>
<p><b>March 2024</b></p>
<p>
  <b
    >You may not threaten to expose, incentivize others to expose, or publish or post other people's private information
    without their express authorization and permission, or share private media of individuals without their consent. <br />
     </b
  >
</p>
<p>
  Sharing someone’s private information online without their permission, sometimes called “doxxing,” is a breach of
  their privacy and can pose serious safety and security risks for those affected.<br />
   
</p>
<p>
  Additionally, posting images is an important part of our users' experience on X. However, where individuals have a
  reasonable expectation of privacy in an individual piece of media, we believe they should be able to determine whether
  or not it is shared. When we are notified by individuals depicted, or their authorized representative, that they did
  not consent to having media shared, we will remove the media. This policy is not applicable to public figures. <br />
   
</p>
<p>
  Lastly, having sexual, nude, or intimate media shared without express consent not only severely violates someone’s
  privacy and psychological safety, but can lead to physical, emotional, and financial hardship and we work tirelessly
  to remove this content immediately.<br />
   
</p>
<p>
  <b>When reviewing reports under our Private Content policies, we consider a number of things, including:</b><br />
   
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      <b>What type of information is being shared? </b>Certain types of private information carry higher risks than
      others, if they’re shared without permission. Our primary goal is to protect individuals from potential physical
      harm as a result of their information being shared, so we consider information such as physical location and phone
      numbers to be a higher risk than other types of information.<br />
       
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <b>Who is sharing the information?</b> It’s important to consider who is sharing the reported information and
      whether or not they have the consent of the person it belongs to. We know there are times when people may want
      some forms of their personal information to be shared publicly, such as for professional networking, coordinating
      social events, or seeking help after a natural disaster. <br />
       
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <b>Is the information available elsewhere online?</b> If the reported information was shared somewhere else before
      it was shared on X, such as someone sharing their personal phone number on their own publicly accessible website,
      we may not consider this information to be private, as the owner has made it publicly available elsewhere.
      However, we may take action against home addresses being shared, even if they are publicly available, due to the
      potential for physical harm. <br />
       
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <b>Why is the information being shared? </b>The intent of the person sharing the information is also important to
      assess before taking action. For example, if we believe that someone is sharing information with abusive intent,
      or to harass another person, we will take action. On the other hand, if someone is sharing information in an
      effort to help someone involved in a crisis situation, we may not take action.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>

<h3>Non-Consensual Nudity</h3>
<p>
  Pornography and other forms of consensually-produced adult content are allowed on X, provided you mark the post or
  <a href="https://help.twitter.com/rules-and-policies/media-settings.html" rel="nofollow"
    >mark your account as sensitive</a
  >. Doing so provides people who may not want to see this type of content with a warning that they will need to
  acknowledge before viewing your media. If you don’t mark your media as sensitive, we may do so manually if your
  content is reported for review. 
</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Right to Privacy</h3>
<p>The following are not in violation of this policy:</p>
<ul>
  <li><p>the media is publicly available or is being covered by mainstream media</p></li>
  <li>
    <p>the media and the accompanying tweet text add value to the public discourse or are shared in public interest</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>the media contains eyewitness accounts or on the ground reports from developing events</p></li>
  <li><p>the subject of the media is a public figure. </p></li>
</ul>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>
  Who can report violations of this policy?<br />
   
</h3>
<h3>Posting Private Information</h3>
<p>
  Anyone can report violations of this policy using our dedicated reporting flow when the private information has been
  shared in a clearly abusive way. When this isn’t the case, we may need to hear directly from the owner of the private
  information (or an authorized representative, such as a lawyer) before taking action. 
</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Non-Consensual Nudity</h3>
<p>
  Due to X allowing some types of adult content on the platform, we may need additional context to determine if the
  content was created or shared without the consent of those involved. This means we may need to hear directly from the
  individual(s) featured (or an authorized representative, such as a lawyer) to ensure that we have sufficient context
  before taking any enforcement action.
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  However, to reduce the burden on those affected by non-consensual media, anyone can report the following types of
  content:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><p>creepshots or upskirts</p></li>
  <li><p>content where a bounty or financial reward is offered in exchange for non-consensual nudity media</p></li>
  <li>
    <p>
      intimate images or videos that are accompanied by text that wishes/hopes for harm to come to those depicted or
      otherwise refers to revenge, such as “I hope you get what you deserve when people see this”
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      intimate images or videos that are accompanied by information that could be used to contact those depicted, such
      as “you can tell my ex what you think by calling them at 123-456-7890.”
    </p>
    <p> </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Right to Privacy</h3>
<p>
  When reporting private media, we need a first person report in order to make the determination that the image or video
  has been shared without their permission. We accept reports from: 
</p>
<ul>
  <li><p>the individuals depicted in the reported media or</p></li>
  <li>
    <p>their authorized representative, such as:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><p>parents/legal guardians</p></li>
      <li><p>lawyers</p></li>
      <li><p>legal representatives.</p></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h3>
  What happens if you violate this policy?<br />
    
</h3>
<p>
  When determining the penalty for violating this policy, we consider a number of factors including, but not limited to
  the severity of the violation and an individual’s previous record of rule violations. The following is a list of
  potential enforcement options for content that violates this policy:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Requiring post removal.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          For example, we may ask someone to remove the violating content and serve a period of time in read-only mode
          before they can post again. Subsequent violations may lead to account suspension.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Suspending accounts whose sole purpose is to post others’ private information or media of any kind. This includes
      accounts dedicated to sharing upskirt or creepshot media.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
