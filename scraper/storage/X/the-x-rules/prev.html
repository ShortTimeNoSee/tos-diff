<h1>The X Rules</h1>

<p>
  X's purpose is to serve the public conversation. Violence, harassment and other similar types of behavior discourage
  people from expressing themselves, and ultimately diminish the value of global public conversation. Our rules are to
  ensure all people can participate in the public conversation freely and safely.<br />
   
</p>
<h3>Safety</h3>
<p>
  Violent Content: You may share graphic media if it is properly labeled, not prominently displayed and is not
  excessively gory or depicting sexual violence, but explicitly threatening, inciting, glorifying, or expressing desire
  for violence is not allowed. <a href="/en/rules-and-policies/violent-speech.html" rel="nofollow">Learn more</a>.

<p>
  Violent &amp; Hateful Entities: You can’t affiliate with or promote the activities of violent and hateful entities.
