<h1>Counterfeit policy</h1>

<p>X prohibits the sale of or promoting the sale of counterfeit goods on the platform.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>What are counterfeit goods?<br /></h3>
<p>
  <br />
  Counterfeit goods are goods, including digital goods, that are promoted, sold, or otherwise distributed using a
  trademark or brand that is identical to, or substantially indistinguishable from, the registered trademark or brand of
  another, without authorization from the trademark or brand owner. Counterfeit goods attempt to deceive consumers into
  believing the counterfeit is a genuine product of the brand owner, or to represent themselves as faux, replicas or
  imitations of the genuine product. 
</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>How is this policy different from X’s trademark policy?</h3>
<p>
  <br />
  X’s trademark policy applies to uses of trademarks that may mislead or confuse others about one’s brand affiliation,
  other than sale or promotion of counterfeit goods. X’s counterfeit policy applies to the sale or promotion of
  counterfeit goods.
</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What is a violation of X’s counterfeit policy?</h3>
<p>
  <br />
  Selling or promoting counterfeit goods on the platform is a violation of X’s counterfeit policy. X’s counterfeit
  policy prohibits but is not limited to:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Non-genuine products that attempt to pass themselves off as genuine products of the trademark or brand owner.</li>
  <li>
    Products described as faux, replicas, or imitations, etc., using a trademark or brand name, without authorization of
    the trademark or brand owner.
  </li>
  <li>The offer, promotion, sale, or facilitation of unauthorized access to content, including digital goods.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h3>How does X respond to counterfeit reports?</h3>
<p>
  <br />
  We review each report and do the following:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    If we determine that there is a violation of our counterfeit policy, we may suspend the account or disable access to
    the material.
  </li>
  <li>
    If you are an advertiser on the X Ads Platform: Promoted content that violates this policy will be rejected and we
    may remove you from the X Ads platform. 
  </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h3>What is not a counterfeit policy violation?</h3>
<h3> </h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Content which provides news, information, or commentary about goods or services is not a violation of this
    counterfeit goods policy. 
  </li>
  <li>Promotion or sale, including resale, of genuine branded goods, may not be a violation.</li>
  <li>
    The use of trademarked materials in a misleading way that does not involve the sale or promotion of counterfeit
    goods would not be a violation of this counterfeit policy, but may be a violation of our
    <a href="/en/rules-and-policies/twitter-trademark-policy.html" rel="nofollow">trademark policy</a>.
  </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
