<p>
  We believe that users should be able to create, distribute, and consume material related to sexual themes as long as
  it is consensually produced and distributed. Sexual expression, whether visual or written, can be a legitimate form of
  artistic expression. We believe in the autonomy of adults to engage with and create content that reflects their own
  beliefs, desires, and experiences, including those related to sexuality. We balance this freedom by restricting
  exposure to Adult Content for children or adult users who choose not to see it. We also prohibit content promoting
  exploitation, nonconsent, objectification, sexualization or harm to minors, and obscene behaviors. We also do not
  allow sharing Adult Content in highly visible places such as profile photos or banners.<br />
</p>

<p>How we define Adult Content  </p>
<p>
  Adult Content is any consensually produced and distributed material depicting adult nudity or sexual behavior that is
  pornographic or intended to cause sexual arousal. This also applies to AI-generated, photographic or animated content
  such as cartoons, hentai, or anime. Examples include depictions of:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>full or partial nudity, including close-ups of genitals, buttocks, or breasts;<br /></li>
  <li>explicit or implied sexual behavior or simulated acts such as sexual intercourse and other sexual acts.</li>
</ul>

<p>Restricted Reach </p>
<p>
  You’re allowed to post Adult Content provided it’s properly labeled with a content warning so users who do not wish to
  see it can avoid it. This also means children below the age of 18 are not exposed to it. If you post content that
  includes any of the following categories, you need to label your content. 
</p>
<p>Adult Nudity</p>
<ul>
  <li><p>visible genitals or anus exposed or focused on or when prominently featured; </p></li>
  <li><p>visible female nipples;</p></li>
  <li><p>fully nude butts.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Sexual Behavior</p>

    <p>
      explicit sexual activity including vaginal, oral or anal sex, usage of sex toys or any form of sexual penetration;
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      implied sexual activity including clothed sexual simulation, states of sexual arousal such as erection or sexual
      activity that is pixelated, blurred, or strategically covered;
    </p>
  </li>
  <li><p>bodily fluids used in sexual context. </p></li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>Allowed</p>
<p>The following content is not considered Adult Content and does not need a content warning:</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Not Allowed  </p>
<p>
  You can’t include Adult Content within areas that are highly visible on X, including in live video, profile pictures,
  headers, List banners, or Community cover photos. Such content must be removed and subsequent violations may result in
  the account being placed in read-only mode or suspended. 
</p>
<p>Adult Content must also comply with all X rules that result in content removal or account suspensions, including:</p>

<p>How to mark your content </p>
<p>
  If you regularly post adult content on X, we ask that you please
  <a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/media-settings" rel="nofollow">adjust</a> your media settings.
  Doing so places all your images and videos behind a content warning that needs to be acknowledged before your media
  can be viewed. You can also add a one-time content warning on individual posts. If you continue to fail marking your
  posts, we will adjust your account settings for you. 
</p>
<p>
  Users under 18 or viewers who do not include a birth date on their profile cannot click to view marked content. Learn
  more about age restricted content
  <a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/notices-on-twitter.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>. 
</p>
<p>
  You may begin to see new media content warnings on posts that X has designated as containing Adult Content (instead of
  a generic sensitive media label). When these new content warnings are available for you to use, please be sure to
  continue marking your media accordingly.<br />
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>How to report </p>
<p>Anyone can report unmarked content or other violations using our dedicated in-app reporting flow. </p>
