<p>Authenticity</p>

<h3>April 2025<br /></h3>
<p><b>You may not engage in inauthentic activity that undermines the integrity of X.</b></p>
<p>
  We want X to be a place where people have authentic experiences. To make that possible, we do not allow any activity
  that attempts to manipulate our platform or disrupt our services through inauthentic <b
    ><a href="#1" rel="nofollow">accounts</a>, <a href="#2" rel="nofollow">behaviors</a> </b
  >or<b> </b><a href="#3" rel="nofollow"><b>content</b>.</a>
</p>

 

<p><b>Inauthentic Accounts </b></p>
<p>
  Accounts on X must be authentic. Under this policy, you may not create, operate, or mass-register accounts that are
  not legitimate, genuine and transparent as to their source, identity, and popularity. This includes: 
</p>
<p>
  <b>Unauthorized automation:</b> Automated or scripted accounts that do not comply with our <a
    href="https://developer.twitter.com/en/developer-terms/agreement-and-policy"
    rel="nofollow"
    >Developer Policy</a
  >. Please note that as a user you are ultimately responsible for third-party applications you may authorize to access
  or use your account. 
</p>
<p>
  <b>Fake personas: </b>You may not use manufactured identities to engage in disruptive or deceptive behavior. This may
  include using stock, stolen or AI-generated profile photos, copied or stolen profile bios, and/or misleading profile
  information for the purpose of deceiving others. 
</p>
<p>
  <b>Impersonation:</b> You may not impersonate other identities of individuals, groups, or organizations to deceive
  others. Although you are not required to display your real identity on your profile, your account should not use false
  profile information to impersonate others. We allow compliant Parody, Commentary, and Fan (PCF) accounts on X only if
  the purpose is to discuss, satirize or share information. If you believe an account is posing as you or your brand,
  you can file a report <a href="https://help.twitter.com/forms/impersonation" rel="nofollow">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
  Accounts may depict another entity as long as they clearly indicate that they are unaffiliated. If your account is a
  Parody, Commentary, or Fan account (PCF), you must meet ALL of the following requirements to clarify its purpose and
  avoid misleading others about its affiliation:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Include a PCF label;</li>
  <li>do not use an identical avatar as the entity;</li>
  <li>include terms such as "parody," "fake," "fan," or "commentary at the beginning of your account name; and</li>
  <li>include terms such as "parody," "fake," "fan," or "commentary in your bio or profile description. </li>
</ul>

  conversations or disrupts X.
