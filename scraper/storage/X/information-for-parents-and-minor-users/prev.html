<p>
  X, as a service, is not primarily for children, but anyone above the age of 13 can sign up for the service. We
  recognize that minors are a more vulnerable group by virtue of their age. The
  <a href="https://help.x.com/rules-and-policies/x-rules" rel="nofollow">X Rules</a> enable minors to participate in the
  public conversation freely and safely, and minors should rely on the X Rules (and report to X) in order to protect
  themselves.
</p>
<p>
  For minors under the age of 18 who sign up for X, we have measures in place to make sure their experience using the
  platform is safe and secure. Here are some key safety and privacy features we have in place:  
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    X’s policies set the minimum age to use the service at 13. X automatically offboards anyone who does not meet our
    age requirements.
  </li>
  <li>
    Accounts belonging to known minors (between 13 and 18 years old) will be defaulted to “Protected posts”. This means
    that known minors will receive a request when new people want to follow them (which they can approve or deny), that
    their posts will only be visible to their followers, and that their posts will only be searchable by them and their
    followers (i.e. they will not appear in public searches). Furthermore, once these accounts enter a date of birth
    that makes them under the age of 18, they will be stopped from re-entering a new date of birth. Please note that if
    an account is set to "public posts," posts from that account may be used for training Grok. To learn more about Grok
    including how to control whether an account's data is used for Grok training please see <a
      href="https://help.x.com/using-x/about-grok"
      rel="nofollow"
      >here</a
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    Accounts belonging to known minors will be
    <a href="https://help.x.com/using-x/direct-messages#receive" rel="nofollow">restricted to receiving DMs</a> from
    accounts they follow by default.
  </li>
  <li>
    X applies restrictions to its
    <a href="https://help.x.com/rules-and-policies/recommendations" rel="nofollow">recommender system</a> by making
    certain categories of potentially harmful content ineligible for inclusion. 
  </li>
  <li>
    While X permits certain types of sensitive media - including consensually produced and shared adult pornography, we
    restrict known minors from
    <a href="https://help.x.com/rules-and-policies/notices-on-x" rel="nofollow">accessing such media</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Users can block accounts instantly if they do not want to see those accounts' posts. Users can also mute an account
    if they don't want to see their posts but don't want to unfollow the account.
  </li>
  <li>
    Users can choose who will be able to reply to their posts when posted. The default position is that everyone can
    reply but options are available to turn off all replies or only allow the accounts mentioned in the post to reply. A
    user can also change who can reply to their posts, or turn off replies, after the post has been posted. 
  </li>
  <li>
    X allows users to report other users who they believe are under the age of 13. X has set up a dedicated
    <a href="https://help.x.com/forms/safety-and-sensitive-content/underage-user" rel="nofollow">reporting form</a> to
    permit any user to report an account that they suspect is being used by a minor under the age of 13.
  </li>
  <li>
    X has a <a href="https://help.x.com/rules-and-policies/glorifying-self-harm" rel="nofollow">policy</a> prohibiting
    users from promoting or encouraging suicide or self-harm. When someone searches for terms associated with suicide or
    self harm, the top search result is a notification encouraging them to reach out for help.<br />
  </li>
  <li>
    X also prohibits knowingly marketing or advertising certain products and services to minors as detailed in the
    following policy: <a
      href="https://business.x.com/help/ads-policies/ads-content-policies/prohibited-content-for-minors"
      rel="nofollow"
      >Prohibited advertising content for minors</a
    >. This policy applies to monetization on X and X’s paid advertising products, and advertisements containing
    age-inappropriate content will be tagged as “not family safe” and will be restricted from being shown to users under
    the age of 21. If an account does not have a date of birth associated with it, X infers the user’s age based on
    their interactions with the site.
  </li>
</ul>
