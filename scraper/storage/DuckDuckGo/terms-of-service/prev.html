<h1>DuckDuckGo Terms of Service</h1>
<p>DuckDuckGo (officially, Duck Duck Go, Inc.) has been an independent company since its founding in 2008.</p>
<p>
  We offer an <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/app?origin=funnel_marketing_website">all-in-one privacy product</a> to
  help protect your everyday online activities. While we started as a search engine, our apps and extensions now offer
  protection well beyond search, including when
  <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/duckduckgo-help-pages/privacy/web-tracking-protections/">browsing websites</a>,
  <a href="https://spreadprivacy.com/protect-your-inbox-with-duckduckgo-email-protection/">reading email</a>, and even
  <a href="https://spreadprivacy.com/app-tracking-protection-open-beta/">using other apps</a>.
</p>
<p>
  These Terms of Service describe the terms and conditions (“Terms”) that apply to all of the services DuckDuckGo and
  its subsidiaries offer, including but not limited to our search engine, apps, and browser extensions, as well as all
  of their associated features (“Services”). By using our Services, you agree to these Terms.

</p>
<h2>We make use of open-source software in our Services.</h2>
<p>
  We retain all intellectual property rights in our Services, but we make the source code and data for many of our
  Services available under
  <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/duckduckgo-help-pages/open-source/opensource-overview/">open-source licenses</a>. To
  build our software, we incorporate and build upon third-party software and services.
</p>
<h2>We do not give you rights to our trademarks if you use our Services.</h2>

</p>
<h2>We are not responsible for content that comes from or is created by third parties.</h2>
<p>
  Many of our Services give you access to content that belongs to other people or organizations, for example, search
  results listing restaurants near you. We have no control over the content on third-party websites, and we cannot
  guarantee that the content you access through our Services is accurate or complete or that the sites you visit are
  unharmful.
</p>
<p>
  Some of the content available through our Services comes in the form of Instant Answers, which you can read more about
  on our <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/duckduckgo-help-pages/results/sources/">Sources page</a>. We make no
  representations or warranties about the accuracy or completeness of the content in our Instant Answers, as it is also
  derived from third-party sources.
</p>
<p>
  If you believe any content violates your intellectual property rights or is otherwise unlawful, you should contact the
  website or service hosting the content to have it removed. To report content to DuckDuckGo, please see our

</p>
<h2>We do not provide a warranty for our Services.</h2>
<p>
  To comply with the law, this section (and the following one) has to be written in more legalese with specific phrases
  and capitalization. Sorry about that — we're not trying to yell at you.
</p>
<p>
  TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, DuckDuckGo and its subsidiaries disclaim all warranties,
  statutory, express, or implied, including, but not limited to, implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a
  particular purpose, and non-infringement of proprietary rights. You expressly agree that the use of our Services is at
  your sole risk. Our Services are provided on an “as is” and “as available,” “with all faults” basis and with no
  assurances that our Services will meet your requirements; that the Services or information made available through the
  Services will be uninterrupted, secure, or error-free, or that defects, if any, will be corrected; or that the
  Services will withstand attempts to evade security mechanisms or that there will be no cracks, bugs, disablements or
  other circumvention.
</p>
<p>SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO THE ABOVE EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p>
<h2>We have limited liability for damages.</h2>
<p>
  IN NO EVENT WILL DUCKDUCKGO, ITS SUBSIDIARIES, OR THEIR RESPECTIVE SHAREHOLDERS, DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES,
  ADVERTISERS, SUPPLIERS, CONTENT PROVIDERS AND LICENSORS (AND ALL SUCCESORS AND ASSIGNS OF ANY OF THE FOREGOING)
  (“DUCKDUCKGO PARTIES”) BE LIABLE (JOINTLY OR SEVERALLY) TO YOU OR ANY OTHER PERSON AS A RESULT OF YOUR ACCESS OR USE
  OF THE SERVICES FOR INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT
  LIMITATION, LOST PROFITS, LOST SAVINGS, LOST REVENUES, OR LOST GOODWILL (COLLECTIVELY, THE “EXCLUDED DAMAGES”),
  REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF THE ACTION, WHETHER THE ALLEGED LIABILITY IS BASED ON NEGLIGENCE, TORT, CONTRACT, OR OTHER
  THEORY OF LIABILITY, EVEN IF THE DUCKDUCKGO PARTIES HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF OR COULD HAVE FORESEEN ANY
  OF THE EXCLUDED DAMAGES.
</p>
<p>
  TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE DUCKDUCKGO PARTIES' MAXIMUM AGGREGATE LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ANY CAUSE AND
  REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF THE ACTION, WILL AT ALL TIMES BE LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT PAID BY YOU FOR USE OF THE RELEVANT
  SERVICES DURING THE PRIOR 12 MONTHS OR ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS ($100) IF YOU HAVE NOT HAD ANY PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS TO US.
</p>
<h2>We are not responsible for events outside of our control.</h2>
<p>
  If our ability to make our Services available is interrupted by an event outside of our control, also known as an
  event of ”force majeure,” we will take steps to minimize the effect of the interruption. We will not be liable for
  delays caused by the event.
</p>
<h2>We offer these Terms under New York law.</h2>
<p>
  Any claim associated with our Services or arising out of these Terms must be filed in the state or federal courts in
  New York, New York, USA, and New York law will govern, regardless of conflict of laws rules.
</p>
<h2>We have written these Terms to be severable.</h2>
<p>If any of these Terms is found to be void or unenforceable, it will not affect the other Terms.</p>
<h2>We will notify you when these Terms change.</h2>
<p>
  We will notify you of changes by posting the modified version at
  <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/terms">https://duckduckgo.com/terms</a>. We will indicate the date it was last
  modified below with an update message on top if substantive changes were made. Continuing to access or use our
  Services after any changes constitutes your consent and agreement to any new terms.
