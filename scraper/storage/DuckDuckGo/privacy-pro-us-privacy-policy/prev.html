<h1>Privacy Pro (U.S.) Privacy Policy and Terms of Service</h1>
<p>Region/Country</p>
<p>USA</p>
<p>
  Privacy Pro is a subscription service that offers additional privacy
  protection for your everyday activities, including DuckDuckGo VPN, Personal
  Information Removal, and Identity Theft Restoration. It is provided by
  DuckDuckGo Subscription, Inc. (“we,” “us,” or “our”), a subsidiary of Duck
  Duck Go, Inc. (“DuckDuckGo”), which provides equipment and services to
  the subsidiary.
</p>
<p>
  This Privacy Pro Privacy Policy and Terms of Service applies if you are based
  in the United States. If you are based outside of the United States, our
  <a
    href="https://duckduckgo.com/pro/privacy-terms/non-us"
    target="_blank"
    rel="noopener"
    >Privacy Pro (non-U.S.) Privacy Policy and Terms of Service</a
  >
  apply.
</p>
<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
<h4>
  We only save the minimal personal information we need for the service
  to function.
</h4>
<p>
  To protect your identity, you do not need to create an account in order to use
  Privacy Pro. Instead, we assign a random ID to your Privacy Pro subscription
  that we use to authorize your subscription on your devices. This random ID is
  not connected to any of your VPN data traffic or credit card information. You
  can optionally add an email address for ease of authorization. We will only
  use personal information you provide (for example, your email address if you
  choose to provide it) to make the service function, including for customer
  support and sending service notices like receipts, and for no other purpose.
  We do not sell any personal information.
</p>
<h3>VPN</h3>
<h4>We don't keep logs of your VPN activity.</h4>
<p>
  We have no way to tie what you do while connected to the DuckDuckGo VPN to you
  as an individual.
</p>
<h4>
  We only keep anonymous performance metrics that we cannot connect to your
  VPN activity.
</h4>
<p>
  Our VPN servers store generic usage and diagnostic data (for example, CPU load
  and errors), but nothing connected to any individual. We use this
  non-identifying information for VPN performance, for example, to ensure VPN
  servers aren't overloaded, under attack, or having network issues.
</p>
<h4>We only use dedicated VPN servers.</h4>
<p>
  This means our VPN servers are not shared with anyone else, such as other
  businesses or service providers. We rent our VPN servers from hosting
  providers carefully selected to meet our privacy requirements. Our VPN servers
  are also physically separated from other DuckDuckGo servers, like those used
  for search infrastructure.
</p>
<h3>Personal Information Removal</h3>
<h4>
  When you enter personal information to have us remove it from data broker
  sites, that data is only saved on your device, not on our servers.
</h4>
<p>
  For example, your name, age and address are all stored locally on your device.
  If we find additional related information on data broker sites, like
  alternative names, or addresses, or the names of your relatives, this
  information is also only stored locally on your device, not on our servers.
</p>
<h4>
  The service submits removal requests to data broker sites on your behalf
  directly from your device, not from our servers.
</h4>
<p>
  This is unlike most other services where removal requests are initiated on
  remote servers. The only personal information we may receive in this process
  are confirmation emails from data broker sites, which we automatically handle
  for you and then delete within 72 hours. We regularly re-scan data broker
  sites to check the removal status of your information. If it has reappeared,
  we resubmit the removal request.
</p>
<h3>Identity Theft Restoration</h3>
<h4>
  We partner with Iris® Powered by Generali, to provide Identity
  Theft Restoration.
</h4>
<p>
  We do not save any additional personal information when you use Identity Theft
  Restoration, nor do we share any personal information with Iris. In the event
  of identity theft, follow the instructions
  <a
    href="https://duckduckgo.com/duckduckgo-help-pages/privacy-pro/identity-theft-restoration/"
    target="_blank"
    rel="noopener"
    >here</a
  >
  to connect with Iris directly.
</p>
<h3>Subscription Management</h3>
<h4>
  We do not process payments ourselves. Instead, we use third-party
  payment processors.
</h4>
<p>
  We use Apple's App Store, Google's Play Store, and Stripe for payment
  processing. They each collect personal information when processing payments
  (for example, payment information) and to monitor the performance of their
  services (for example, device information for fraud detection and analytics).
  Their respective privacy policies and terms of service apply here.
</p>
<h4>
  We offer support at
  <a href="mailto:privacypro@duckduckgo.com">privacypro@duckduckgo.com</a>.
</h4>
<p>
  If you reach out to us for support by emailing
  <a href="mailto:privacypro@duckduckgo.com">privacypro@duckduckgo.com</a> or by
  reporting an issue from the DuckDuckGo app and agree to be contacted to
  troubleshoot the issue, we may contact you using the email address provided.
  We use a third-party customer support platform to store and facilitate our
  responses to customer support requests
</p>
<p>
  We retain support emails for only as long as we need to resolve your support
  issue, or for other business purposes such as resolving disputes, safety and
  security reasons, or complying with our legal obligations.
</p>
<h4>
  When you cancel Privacy Pro, we promptly delete the limited personal
  information we have.
</h4>
<p>
  Depending on how you subscribe, you can cancel through Apple's App Store,
  Google's Play Store, or Stripe via the DuckDuckGo app. We keep backups for 30
  days, so it will take 30 days from when you cancel Privacy Pro to remove any
  personal information we may have from our systems (for example, your email
  address), unless we are legally required to keep it longer such as for
  resolving disputes.
</p>
<p>
  DuckDuckGo's general
  <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
    >Privacy Policy</a
  >
  also applies here and applies to DuckDuckGo Subscription, Inc., just as if it
  were included as part of “DuckDuckGo” in the general DuckDuckGo Privacy
  Policy. If there's a conflict with the DuckDuckGo general Privacy Policy, the
  terms of this policy apply.
</p>
<h3>Terms of Service</h3>

  these terms and the
  <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/terms" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
    >DuckDuckGo Terms of Service</a
  >, which are incorporated by reference and apply to DuckDuckGo Subscription,
  Inc., just as if it were included as part of “DuckDuckGo” in those Terms of
  Service. If these terms conflict with the DuckDuckGo Terms of Service, these
  terms will govern.
</p>
<h4>You must be eligible.</h4>
<p>
  To use Privacy Pro, you must be the age of majority in your jurisdiction and

<p>
  You must enroll in a monthly or annual subscription (a “Subscription”) from
  us, which may begin with a free trial, to use Privacy Pro and you agree to
  provide accurate information that does not infringe on the rights of any third
  party when doing so.
</p>
<h4>You may not let others use your subscription.</h4>

  Privacy Pro is for your personal noncommercial use only and you are solely
  responsible for all activities that occur through your Subscription. You may
  not assign your Subscription or authorize its use to others.
</p>
<h4>You must only use Privacy Pro with official DuckDuckGo browsers.</h4>
<p>
  To access and use Privacy Pro, you must download and install a DuckDuckGo
  browser from the DuckDuckGo website or an authorized third-party app store
  (“Official Apps”). You may not attempt to integrate or otherwise use Privacy
  Pro in connection with any technology, interfaces, or builds (including those
  authorized by the applicable open-source licenses) other than Official Apps.
</p>
<h4>You understand the services available to you.</h4>
<p>
  Privacy Pro is only available under these terms in the U.S. The services may

  cancel your Subscription.
</p>
<h4>You understand the third-party policies applicable to your purchase.</h4>
<p>
  Subscription purchases are processed and managed by either Apple's App Store,
  Google's Play Store, or by Stripe, and you are subject to the terms and
  privacy policies of the applicable third party. For Apple and Google
  purchases, we do not have the ability to initiate, cancel, or refund your
  Subscription on your behalf; you must go directly through them.
</p>
<h4>You authorize us to charge a subscription fee.</h4>
<p>
  You authorize DuckDuckGo Subscription, Inc., through the applicable payment
  processor, to charge you the subscription fee and applicable taxes through the
  payment method that you provide. If your transaction cannot be processed, we
  may suspend or terminate your Subscription. If your subscription includes a
  free trial, you will not be charged the applicable fee during your free trial,
  but you will be required to provide a payment method to ensure uninterrupted
  access after the free trial ends. Unless you cancel before your free trial
  ends, your paid subscription will automatically begin at that time, and your
  payment method will be charged the applicable fee. Any free trial period is at
  our sole discretion, and we may limit eligibility or duration to prevent
  misuse. Trials and promotional subscriptions may be limited to one per
  household and you may also be limited in your ability to combine promotions.
</p>
<h4>You agree to automatic renewal of Privacy Pro.</h4>
<p>
  By purchasing Privacy Pro, you are subscribing to an automatically renewing
  Subscription requiring recurring payments at the stated price (including any
  applicable taxes) and frequency (for example, monthly or annually) until you
  cancel. Privacy Pro will automatically renew at the beginning of each billing
  period. If the Subscription includes a promotional rate, you will be charged
  the promotional rate for the relevant number of billing periods and then will
  automatically renew at the then-applicable full rate.
</p>
<h4>You may cancel Privacy Pro at any time.</h4>
<p>
  You can cancel Privacy Pro at any time before the end of your free trial or
  before your next renewal by going to Settings in the DuckDuckGo app and
  following the link to cancel or, for Subscriptions purchased through a
  third-party app store, through that third party. If you cancel, your right to
  use Privacy Pro will continue until the end of the current billing period and
  will then terminate without further charges. Except as required by applicable
  law, you will not receive a refund.
</p>
<h4>We are not responsible for events outside our control.</h4>
<p>
  If our ability to make Privacy Pro available is interrupted by an event
  outside our control, also known as an event of “force majeure,” then we will
  inform you as soon as possible, to the extent we are able, and we will take
  steps to minimize the effect of the interruption. Provided we do this, we will
  not be liable for delays caused by the event but if there is a risk of
  substantial delay you may contact us to end your contract with us and receive
  a refund for any services you have paid for but not received.
</p>
<h4>You agree to use Privacy Pro as authorized.</h4>
<p>
  You agree to comply with the
  <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/acceptable-use" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

    personal information from data broker sites. Because data broker sites often

    removal of your personal information.

    assistance to improve your credit record or rating, only to fix errors
