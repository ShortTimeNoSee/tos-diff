<h1>Duck.ai Privacy Policy and Terms of Use</h1>
<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>When you interact with Duck.ai, responses (“Outputs”) are generated based on the text you submit (“Prompts”).</p>
<h3>
  We do not save or store your Prompts or Outputs on DuckDuckGo servers. Instead, recent chats are optionally saved
  locally on your device, to protect your privacy.
</h3>
<p>
  Your recent chats are automatically saved locally on your device (instead of on DuckDuckGo servers or other remote
  servers) unless you opt out. You can delete a recent chat by clicking the delete icon next to it. You can delete all
  recent chats at once by either using the Fire Button within Duck.ai or clearing your browser data. Recent chats are
  also automatically deleted after 30 conversations. Additionally, you should know some browsers automatically delete
  recent chats if you have not accessed Duck.ai within so many days, while others retain data for extended periods or
  indefinitely, unless you explicitly clear it.
</p>
<p>
  All metadata that contains personal information (for example, your IP address) is removed before sending Prompts to
  underlying model providers (for example, Anthropic, Azure OpenAI, OpenAI, together.ai). If you submit personal
  information in your Prompts, it may be reproduced in the Outputs, but no one can tell (including us and the underlying
  model providers) whether it was you personally submitting the Prompts or someone else.
</p>
<h3>We have agreements with model providers to further protect your privacy.</h3>
<p>
  As noted above, we call model providers on your behalf so your personal information (for example, IP address) is not
  exposed to them. In addition, we have agreements in place with all model providers that further limit how they can use
  data from these anonymous requests, including not using Prompts and Outputs to develop or improve their models, as
  well as deleting all information received once it is no longer necessary to provide Outputs (at most within 30 days,
  with limited exceptions for safety and legal compliance).
</p>
<p>
  Our general <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/privacy">Privacy Policy</a> also applies here. If there is a conflict with
  our general Privacy Policy, this Duck.ai Privacy Policy applies.
</p>
<h2>Terms of Service</h2>
<h3>You retain all intellectual property rights in your Prompts and Outputs.</h3>
<p>
  We claim no ownership of either your Prompts or Outputs. You grant us a limited intellectual property license
  permitting us only to process your Prompts and provide you the Outputs consistent with our Privacy Policy. You
  represent and warrant that you have all necessary rights and permissions to include any personal data or third-party
  content in your Prompts.
</p>
<h3>Outputs may be inaccurate, incomplete, or otherwise unreliable.</h3>
<p>
  By its very nature, Duck.ai generates text with limited information. As such, Outputs that appear complete or accurate
  because of their detail or specificity may not be. For example, Duck.ai cannot dynamically retrieve information so
  Outputs may be outdated. You should not rely on any Output without verifying its contents using other sources,
  especially for professional advice (like medical, financial, or legal advice). If you use Duck.ai for coding related
  tasks, we are not, and the model providers are not, responsible for coding errors or vulnerabilities.
</p>
<h3>Outputs may be offensive.</h3>
<p>Outputs don't represent our views.</p>
<h3>Duck.ai is only intended for and available to people who are age 13 or older.</h3>
<p>
  If you are under the age of majority in your jurisdiction, you must have your parent or legal guardian's permission to
  use Duck.ai.
</p>
<h3>
  The models accessible through Duck.ai are subject to the model provider's usage policies. Broadly, that means that
  using Duck.ai for illegal, harmful, regulated, and sexually explicit purposes is prohibited.
</h3>
<p>
  Duck.ai allows you to use models from leading model providers without being tracked. These model providers have usage
  policies, and our Terms therefore mirror those policies. For example, usage policies from

  </li>
  <li>
    Interfering with or negatively impacting Duck.ai or other DuckDuckGo Services, including automated querying and
    developing or offering AI services, such as training an AI model.
  </li>

<h3>Safety features created by model providers may try to prevent you from misusing Duck.ai.</h3>
<p>
  To avoid misuse, model providers embed safety mechanisms to block certain Prompts and the generation of certain
  Outputs.
