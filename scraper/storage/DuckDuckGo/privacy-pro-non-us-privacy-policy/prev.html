<p>
  Privacy Pro is a subscription service that offers additional privacy
  protection for your everyday activities, including DuckDuckGo VPN and Identity
  Theft Restoration. It is provided by DuckDuckGo Subscription, Inc. (“we,”
  “us,” or “our”), a subsidiary of Duck Duck Go, Inc. (“DuckDuckGo”), which
  provides equipment and services to the subsidiary.
</p>
<p>
  This Privacy Policy and Terms of Service applies if you are based outside of
  the United States, currently available only in the UK, EU and Canada. If you
  are based in the United States, our
  <a
    href="https://duckduckgo.com/pro/privacy-terms/us"
    target="_blank"
    rel="noopener"
    >Privacy Pro (U.S.) Privacy Policy and Terms of Service</a
  >
  apply.
</p>
<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
<h4>
  We only save the minimal personal information we need for the service
  to function.
</h4>
<p>
  To protect your identity, you do not need to create an account in order to use
  Privacy Pro. Instead, we assign a random ID to your Privacy Pro subscription
  that we use to authorize your subscription on your devices. This random ID is
  considered personal information under some privacy laws, but this random ID is
  not connected to any of your VPN traffic data or credit card information. You
  can optionally add an email address for ease of authorization. We will only
  use personal information you provide (for example, your email address if you
  choose to provide it) to make the service function, including for customer
  support and sending service notices like receipts, and for no other purpose.
  Our legal basis for using your personal information in this manner is to
  provide Privacy Pro to you, that is performance of this contract and other
  legitimate interests like responding to any customer service issues you raise.
  We do not sell any personal information.
</p>
<h3>VPN</h3>
<h4>We don't keep logs of your VPN activity.</h4>
<p>
  We have no way to tie what you do while connected to the DuckDuckGo VPN to you
  as an individual.
</p>
<h4>
  We only keep anonymous performance metrics that we cannot connect to your
  VPN activity.
</h4>
<p>
  Our VPN servers store generic usage and diagnostic data (for example, CPU load
  and errors), but nothing connected to any individual. We use this
  non-identifying information for VPN performance, for example, to ensure VPN
  servers aren't overloaded, under attack, or having network issues.
</p>
<h4>We only use dedicated VPN servers.</h4>
<p>
  This means our VPN servers are not shared with anyone else, such as other
  businesses or service providers. We rent our VPN servers from hosting
  providers carefully selected to meet our privacy requirements. Our VPN servers
  are also physically separated from other DuckDuckGo servers, like those used
  for search infrastructure.
</p>
<h3>Identity Theft Restoration</h3>
<h4>
  We partner with Iris® Powered by Generali, to provide Identity
  Theft Restoration.
</h4>
<p>
  We do not save any additional personal information when you use Identity Theft
  Restoration, nor do we share any personal information with Iris. In the event
  of identity theft, follow the instructions
  <a
    href="https://duckduckgo.com/duckduckgo-help-pages/privacy-pro/identity-theft-restoration/"
    target="_blank"
    rel="noopener"
    >here</a
  >
  to connect with Iris directly.
</p>
<h3>Subscription Management</h3>
<h4>
  We do not process payments ourselves. Instead, we use third-party
  payment processors.
</h4>
<p>
  We use Apple's App Store and Google's Play Store for payment processing. They
  each collect personal information when processing payments (for example,
  payment information) and to monitor the performance of their services (for
  example, device information for fraud detection and analytics). Their
  respective privacy policies and terms of service apply here.
</p>
<h4>
  We offer support at
  <a href="mailto:privacypro@duckduckgo.com">privacypro@duckduckgo.com</a>.
</h4>
<p>
  If you reach out to us for support by emailing
  <a href="mailto:privacypro@duckduckgo.com">privacypro@duckduckgo.com</a> or by
  reporting an issue from the DuckDuckGo app and agree to be contacted to
  troubleshoot the issue, we may contact you using the email address provided.
  Our legal basis for using your information like this is performance of a
  contract, so that we can provide Privacy Pro to you.
</p>
<p>
  We retain support emails for only as long as we need to resolve your support
  issue, or for our other legitimate interests, such as resolving disputes,
  safety and security reasons, or complying with our legal obligations.
</p>
<h4>
  When you cancel Privacy Pro, we promptly delete the limited personal
  information we have.
</h4>
<p>
  Depending on how you subscribe, you can cancel through Apple's App Store or
  Google's Play Store via the DuckDuckGo app. We keep backups for 30 days, so it
  will take 30 days from when you cancel Privacy Pro to remove any personal
  information we may have from our systems (for example, your email address),
  unless we are legally required to keep it longer such as for
  resolving disputes.
</p>
<h3>Personal Information Sharing and Transfers</h3>
<h4>We protect your personal information when it is shared and transferred.</h4>
<p>
  When providing Privacy Pro, we may need to share some of the limited personal
  information we collect from you. For example, if you reach out to us for
  support as described above, we use a third-party customer service support
  platform to store and facilitate our responses.
</p>
<p>
  There are also scenarios where we may transfer the limited personal
  information we collect from you to countries other than the country in which
  it was received. We protect your personal information by entering into Data
  Processing Agreements and Standard Contractual Clauses with third parties.

  These terms are a binding legal agreement between you and DuckDuckGo
  Subscription, Inc. By purchasing and/or using Privacy Pro, as described

    href="https://duckduckgo.com/duckduckgo-help-pages/privacy-pro/"
    target="_blank"
    rel="noopener"

  <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/terms" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
    >DuckDuckGo Terms of Service</a
  >, which are incorporated by reference and apply to DuckDuckGo Subscription,
  Inc., just as if it were included as part of “DuckDuckGo” in those Terms of
  Service. If these terms conflict with the DuckDuckGo Terms of Service, these
  terms will govern.
</p>
<h4>You must be eligible.</h4>
<p>
  To use Privacy Pro, you must be of age to conclude contracts in your
  jurisdiction and live in a location where we offer Privacy Pro. If you have
  been previously suspended or removed from any services offered by DuckDuckGo,
  you are not eligible.
</p>
<h4>You must enroll in a subscription.</h4>
<p>
  You must enroll in a monthly or annual subscription (a “Subscription”) from us
  through Apple's App Store or Google's Play Store, which may begin with a free
  trial, to use Privacy Pro and you agree to provide accurate information that
  does not infringe on the rights of any third party when doing so.
</p>
<h4>You may not let others use your subscription.</h4>
<p>
  Privacy Pro is for your personal noncommercial use only and you are solely
  responsible for all activities that occur through your Subscription. You may
  not assign your Subscription or authorize its use to others.
</p>
<h4>You must only use Privacy Pro with official DuckDuckGo browsers.</h4>
<p>
  To access and use Privacy Pro, you must download and install a DuckDuckGo
  browser from the DuckDuckGo website or from Apple's App Store or Google's Play
  Store (“Official Apps”). You may not attempt to integrate or otherwise use
  Privacy Pro in connection with any technology, interfaces, or builds
  (including those authorized by the applicable open-source licenses) other than
  Official Apps.
</p>
<h4>You understand the services available to you.</h4>
<p>
  Privacy Pro is only available under these terms in the UK, EU and Canada. The
  services may not be available for all operating systems or their versions. We
  may modify the Privacy Pro services and their terms at any time in our sole
  discretion. If we make any material changes to the Privacy Pro services and
  its terms, we will share an updated version of the terms through the
  DuckDuckGo app with a summary of the changes. If you do not wish to continue
  subscribing with the modifications, you may cancel your Subscription.
  Continued use of Privacy Pro will constitute your acceptance of any changes to
  the terms.
</p>
<h4>You understand the third-party policies applicable to your purchase.</h4>
<p>
  Subscription purchases are processed and managed by either Apple's App Store
  or Google's Play Store, and you are subject to the terms and privacy policies
  of the applicable third party. We do not have the ability to initiate, cancel,
  or refund your Subscription on your behalf; you must go directly through
  Apple's App Store or Google's Play Store, as applicable.
</p>
<h4>You authorize us to charge a subscription fee.</h4>
<p>
  You authorize DuckDuckGo Subscription, Inc., through the Official Apps, to
  charge you the subscription fee and applicable taxes through the payment
  method that you provide. If your transaction cannot be processed, we may
  suspend or terminate your Subscription. If your subscription includes a free
  trial, you will not be charged the applicable fee during your free trial, but
  you will be required to provide a payment method to ensure uninterrupted
  access after the free trial ends. Unless you cancel before your free trial
  ends or before the end of the 14-day “right-of-withdrawal” period, your paid
  Subscription will automatically begin at that time, and your payment method
  will be charged the applicable fee. Any free trial period is at our sole
  discretion, and we may limit eligibility or duration to prevent misuse. Trials
  and promotional subscriptions may be limited to one per household and you may
  also be limited in your ability to combine promotions.
</p>
<p>
  We reserve the right to increase the Subscription fee during the term of any
  Subscription. We will notify you at least 30 days in advance of any such
  increase, providing our reasons and confirming when the increase will take
  effect. If you do not consent to the increase, you may cancel your
  Subscription without incurring any penalty.
</p>
<h4>You agree to automatic renewal of Privacy Pro.</h4>
<p>
  By purchasing Privacy Pro, you are subscribing to an automatically renewing
  Subscription requiring recurring payments at the stated price (including any
  applicable taxes) and frequency (for example, monthly or annually) until you
  cancel. Privacy Pro will automatically renew at the beginning of each billing
  period. We will notify you in advance as required by law. If you do not wish
  to renew your Subscription, you must cancel in advance of the renewal date. If
  the Subscription includes a promotional rate, you will be charged the
  promotional rate for the relevant number of billing periods and then will
  automatically renew at the then-applicable full rate.
</p>
<h4>You may cancel Privacy Pro at any time.</h4>
<p>
  You have a 14-day “right of withdrawal” period beginning at the start of the
  Subscription, via the withdrawal form made available by Google or Apple,
  depending on how you subscribed to Privacy Pro. During this time, you can
  cancel your Subscription without incurring any penalty.
</p>
<p>
  In addition to the cancellation rights set out above, you can cancel Privacy
  Pro at any time before the end of your free trial or before your next renewal
  via either Apple's App Store or Google's Play Store subscription settings,
  depending on how you subscribed to Privacy Pro. If you cancel, your right to
  use Privacy Pro will continue until the end of the current Subscription period
  and will then terminate without further charges. Except as required by
  applicable law, you will not receive a refund.
</p>
<h4>We are not responsible for events outside our control.</h4>
<p>
  If our ability to make Privacy Pro available is interrupted by an event
  outside our control, also known as an event of “force majeure,” then we will
  inform you as soon as possible, to the extent we are able, and we will take
  steps to minimise the effect of the interruption. Provided we do this, we will
  not be liable for delays caused by the event but if there is a risk of
  substantial delay you may contact us to end your contract with us and receive
  a refund for any services you have paid for but not received.
</p>
<h4>You agree to use Privacy Pro as authorized.</h4>
<p>
  You agree to comply with the
  <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/acceptable-use" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
    >DuckDuckGo Acceptable Use Policy</a
  >, which is incorporated by reference.
</p>
<p>
  We reserve the right to suspend and/or terminate your access to Privacy Pro
  (or portions thereof), in the event of force majeure or in the event of
  violation of these terms or applicable laws by you, whether these are repeated
  violations or a single instance.
</p>
<p>
  In addition, we reserve the right at any time and in our sole discretion, with
  or without notice, to suspend and/or terminate your access to Privacy Pro (or
  portions thereof) where we deem it reasonably necessary to do so to protect
  the service, our IT networks and systems including hosting providers, any user
  or users, to comply with our legal obligations, or where we otherwise
  determine it appropriate to do so.
</p>
<h4>We have limited liability for damages.</h4>

  respective shareholders, directors, officers, employees, subcontractors,
  advertisers, suppliers, content providers and licensors (and all successors
  and assigns of any of the foregoing).

  Pro or your Subscription which is unforeseeable, is not caused by us and/or is
  indirect, consequential, special, incidental, punitive, or exemplary.
</p>
<p>
  If we fail to comply with these terms, we are responsible for loss or damage
  you suffer that is a foreseeable result of our breaking these terms or our
  failing to use reasonable care and skill. Loss or damage is foreseeable if
  either it is obvious that it will happen or if, at the time you accepted these
  terms, both we and you knew it might happen.
</p>
<p>
  We are not liable for business losses. Privacy Pro is for domestic and private
  use. If you use Privacy Pro for any commercial, business or resale purpose we
  will have no liability to you under any theory of liability.
</p>
<p>
  We do not exclude or limit in any way our liability to you where it would be
  unlawful to do so.
</p>
<p>
  To the fullest extent permitted by law, our maximum aggregate liability to you
  in connection with Privacy Pro or your Subscription for any cause and
  regardless of the form of the action, will at all times be limited to the
  amount paid by you for use of the Subscription during the prior 12 months.
</p>
<h4>We offer these Terms under English law.</h4>
<p>
  These terms and your use of Privacy Pro is governed under the laws of England
  and Wales, or, where applicable under mandatory provisions of local law. Any
  claim associated with these terms will be subject to the jurisdiction of the
  courts of England and Wales, or, in the case where mandatory provisions of
  local law apply, any courts that are deemed to have jurisdiction.
</p>
<p>
  Nothing in these Terms of Service affects any statutory consumer rights that
  cannot be waived or limited. You may have additional consumer rights under
  applicable local laws. For more information in the event of a dispute please
