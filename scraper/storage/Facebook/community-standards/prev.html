<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>
  Every day, people use Facebook, Instagram, Messenger and Threads to share
  their experiences, connect with friends and family, and build communities. Our
  services enable billions of people to freely express themselves across
  countries and cultures and in dozens of languages.
</p>
<p>
  Meta recognizes how important it is for Facebook, Instagram, Messenger and
  Threads to be places where people feel empowered to communicate, and we take
  our role seriously in keeping abuse off the service. That’s why we developed
  standards for what is and isn’t allowed on these services.
</p>
<p>
  These standards are based on feedback from people and the advice of experts in
  fields like technology, public safety and human rights. To ensure everyone’s
  voice is valued, we take great care to create standards that include different
  views and beliefs, especially from people and communities that might otherwise
  be overlooked or marginalized.

    the most up to date set of the policies and should be used as the primary
