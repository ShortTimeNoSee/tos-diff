        <p><strong>Music Guidelines</strong></p>
        <br />
        <p>
          These supplemental terms apply if you post, share, or promote any videos or other content containing music on
          any <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/1561485474074139">Meta Products</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>You are responsible for the content you post or promote</strong><br /><br />
          People use our Products to share content with their fans, family and friends. Keep in mind you remain solely
          responsible for the content that you post or promote, including any music that is featured in that content.
          Nothing in these terms constitutes any authorization by us with respect to any use of music on any of our
          Products. <br /><br />
          Use of music for commercial or non-personal purposes in particular is prohibited unless you have obtained
          appropriate licenses. Eligibility for, and participation in, Music Revenue Sharing does not by itself make a
          video commercial.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>You may not use content on our Products to create a music listening experience </strong><br /><br />
          We want your fans, family and friends to be able to enjoy your content. However, if you use videos or other
          content on our Products to create a music listening experience for yourself or for others, your content may be
          blocked and your page, profile or group may be deleted. This includes live videos.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Unauthorized content may be removed</strong><br /><br />
          If you post content that contains music owned by someone else, your content may be reviewed by the applicable
          rights owner and your content may be blocked, muted or removed if your use of that music is not properly
          authorized.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>You may not be able to post or access content containing music in every country of the world</strong
          ><br /><br />
          We want you to be able to share content with your fans, family and friends wherever they are, but any music in
          your content, if it is allowed at all, may not be available in all countries of the world.
        </p>
        <p><strong>The following guidelines can help you plan for your content:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The greater the density of music in content, the more likely it may be limited (e.g., blocked, muted or
            ineligible for <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/help/516305840204016">Music Revenue Share</a>)
          </li>
          <li>Shorter clips of music are recommended</li>
          <li>
            There should always be a visual component to your content; recorded audio should not be the primary purpose
            of the content
          </li>
          <li>

          </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <p>
          <strong>You may be able to dispute the action taken on your content</strong><br /><br />
          If you believe you have the rights to use the music content that was restricted, or that an action was taken
          in error, you may be able to dispute that action via the notification you received. Depending on the nature of
          restriction, our tools may enable you to contact the applicable rights holder directly; the content may be
          automatically restored; or your dispute may be reviewed by a member of Metaâ€™s operations teams to confirm
          these policies were appropriately applied.
