        We’re updating the Self-Serve Ad Terms. These updates will go into
        effect on August 22, 2025. Your use of the Self-Serve Ad Interfaces on
        or after that date will be subject to the updated terms.<a

        Self-Serve Ad Terms
        <p>
          The following terms (“<strong>Self-Serve Advertising Terms</strong>”
          or “<strong>Self-Serve Ad Terms</strong>”) apply to your use of
          <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/1561485474074139"
            >Meta Products</a
          >
          (such as the self-service advertising interfaces and APIs) for
          creation, submission and/or delivery of any advertising or other
          commercial or sponsored activity or content (collectively, “<strong
            >Self-Serve Ad Interfaces</strong
          >”) and any order you place through the Self-Serve Ad Interfaces
          (“<strong>Order</strong>”).
        </p>
        <p>
          You can target your desired audience by buying ads to be delivered on
          Facebook, Messenger, Instagram, our publisher network, or any place we
          serve ads.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            When you place an Order, you will tell us the type of advertising
            you want to buy, the amount you want to spend, and your bid. If we
            accept your Order, we will deliver your ads as inventory becomes
            available. Subject to Section 5, when serving your ad, we use best
            efforts to deliver the ads to the audience you specify or to achieve
            the outcome you select, though we cannot guarantee in every instance
            that your ad will reach its intended target or achieve the outcome
            you select.
            <p></p>
          </li>
          <li>
            Your ads must comply with all applicable laws, regulations, and
            guidelines, as well as our
            <a href="https://www.facebook.com/policies/ads/"
              >Advertising Policies</a
            >. Failure to comply may result in a variety of consequences,
            including the cancellation of ads you have placed and termination of
            your account.
            <p></p>
          </li>
          <li>
            We may reject or remove any ad for any reason.
            <p></p>
          </li>
          <li>
            You will pay for your Orders in accordance with the following:
            <ol>
              <li>
                You will comply with our
                <a href="https://www.facebook.com/payments_terms"
                  >Community Payments Terms</a
                >
                to the extent applicable.
                <p></p>
              </li>
              <li>
                You will pay all amounts specified in each Order you place,
                along with any applicable taxes. The amount you owe for each
                Order will be calculated based on our tracking mechanisms.
                <p></p>
              </li>
              <li>
                By placing an Order, you authorize us to obtain your personal
                and/or business credit report from a credit bureau, either when
                you place an Order or at any time thereafter.
                <p></p>
              </li>
              <li>
                You are responsible for maintaining the security of your
                advertising account, and you understand that you will be charged
                for any Orders placed on or through your advertising account.
                <p></p>
              </li>
              <li>
                If you are making direct debit payments, you agree that we can
                charge you any amount that falls within the range you agreed to
                upon signup. We will notify you in advance if any charge will
                exceed the agreed-upon range.
                <p></p>
              </li>
              <li>
                You can cancel an Order at any time, but your ads may run for 24
                hours after you notify us, and you are still responsible for
                paying for all ads that run.
                <p></p>
              </li>
              <li>
                The amounts we charge you may be subject to and include
                applicable taxes and levies, including without limitation
                withholding taxes. You are responsible for bearing and remitting
                any taxes that apply to your transactions. You will indemnify
                and hold us harmless from and against any claim arising out of
                your failure to do so.
                <p></p>
              </li>
              <li>
                If your payment method fails or your account is past due, we may
                take additional steps to collect past due amounts. You will pay
                all expenses associated with such collection, including
                reasonable attorneys' fees. Past due amounts will accrue
                interest at 1% per month or the lawful maximum, whichever is
                less.
                <p></p>
              </li>
              <li>
                We may allow you to purchase ads with an “Advertiser Balance,”
                which is a pre-paid balance that can be used solely to purchase
                ads on Meta. Advertiser Balances are only for business or
                commercial purposes. Advertiser Balances are non-refundable
                except where required by law. Meta is not a bank and does not
                offer banking services; accordingly, Advertiser Balances do not
                earn interest, are not deposit obligations, and are not insured
                by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Financial
                Services Compensation Scheme, or any other entity or insurance
                scheme, whether governmental or private.
                <p></p>
              </li>
              <li>
                You will fall under one of two categories depending on your
                payment method: invoiced or non-invoiced client. Invoiced
                clients are those for whom Meta sets a maximum spending limit
                and issues invoices on a periodic basis for payment in
                accordance with the applicable invoicing terms. Non-invoiced
                clients are those who must make payments at the time of purchase
                itself. In its sole discretion, Meta may classify clients as
                invoiced clients based on factors such as ad spend and
                creditworthiness.
              </li>

            <p></p>
          </li>
          <li>
            You understand that, from time to time, we run tests on our
            Self-Serve Ad Interfaces and related systems, which may impact your
            use and experience thereof, including campaign performance. You
            acknowledge and agree that we may test as notified in these Terms,
            including to assess formatting, relevance, pricing, reporting,
            targeting, and delivery.
            <p></p>
          </li>
          <li>
            We will determine the size, placement, and positioning of your ads.
            <p></p>
          </li>
          <li>
            Scheduling of delivery is subject to availability and may not be
            continuous.
            <p></p>
          </li>
          <li>
            We do not guarantee the reach or performance that your ads will
            receive, such as the number of people who will see your ads or the
            number of clicks your ads will get.
            <p></p>
          </li>
          <li>
            We cannot control how clicks are generated on your ads. We have
            systems that attempt to detect and filter certain click activity,
            but we are not responsible for click fraud, technological issues, or
            other potentially invalid click activity that may affect the cost of
            running ads.
            <p></p>
          </li>
          <li>
            Our license to deliver your ad will end when we have completed your
            Order. You understand, however, that:
            <ol>
              <li>
                Once displayed, ads are public information. Ads may be re-shared
                and accessed outside of the targeted audience (including from
                the Facebook Page or profile or Instagram Professional Account
                running the ads or within Meta Products). If users have
                interacted with your ad, your ad may remain on our Products (<em
                  >e.g., shared until the users delete it or visible to users
                  through their account tools).

                >, Meta may display (at no cost to you) and provide access to
                the ad content and creative, and information about the ad
                campaign (such as total spend and delivery data, and targeting
                information) for a period of seven years from the completion of
                your order.
                <p></p>
              </li>
              <li>
                You consent that Meta may disclose your advertising content, and
                all information associated with your advertising, to a
                governmental entity or body if Meta believes that disclosure
                would assist in a lawful investigation.

            <p></p>
          </li>

            We will provide you with reports about the kinds of people seeing
            your ads and how your ads are performing. Your use of these reports
            is subject to the Data Use Restrictions in our
            <a href="https://www.facebook.com/policies/ads/"
              >Advertising Policies</a

            business, with information about the number of ads being run for the
            business across the Meta Products and any applicable restrictions on
            those ads.
            <p></p>
          </li>
          <li>
            We offer tools to provide transparency to our users about how Meta
            advertising works and control over their ads experience, including
            information sufficient to show them why they are being shown
            specific ads. You agree that information associated with your
            advertising may be included in these tools, and that those tools may
            impact your ability to advertise to those users or to prevent them
            from seeing your ads.
            <p></p>
          </li>
          <li>
            You will not issue any press release or make public statements about
            your relationship with Meta or the Meta Products without our prior
            written permission.
            <p></p>
          </li>
          <li>
            If you are placing ads on someone else's behalf, you must have
            permission to place those ads, and agree as follows:
            <ol>
              <li>
                You represent and warrant that you have the authority to and
                will bind the advertiser to these Self-Serve Ad Terms and the
                Terms of Service, and the
                <a href="https://www.facebook.com/legal/commercial_terms"
                  >Commercial Terms</a
                >, to which you also agree.

              </li>
              <li>
                If the advertiser you represent violates these Self-Serve Ad
                Terms, the Terms of Service, or the Commercial Terms, we may
                hold you responsible for that violation.
                <p></p>
              </li>
              <li>
                You agree that we may provide campaign reporting information to
                the end advertiser for whom you placed a campaign.
              </li>

            <p></p>

            We may ask you to review and accept supplemental terms that apply to
            your use of a specific feature or functionality made available
            through the Self-Serve Ad Interfaces. To the extent those
            supplemental terms conflict with these Self-Serve Ad Terms, the
            supplemental terms will govern with respect to your use of the
            specific feature or functionality to the extent of the conflict. We
            may change or update these Self-Serve Ad Terms from time to time and
            your continued use of the Self-Serve Ad Interfaces constitutes
            acceptance of those changes.

                subject to special provisions regarding Orders they place,

                directly with Meta affiliate companies solely for purposes of
                placing Orders. If applicable to you, you can find these special
