        <p>
          The following terms, as well as our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/">Data Policy</a> and
          <a href="https://www.facebook.com/legal/terms">Statement of Rights and Responsibilities</a>, apply to all
          Pages on Facebook. Additionally, all content on Pages must comply with our
          <a href="https://www.facebook.com/communitystandards">Community Standards</a>. You are responsible for
          ensuring that your Page complies with all applicable laws, statutes, and regulations.
        </p>
        <p><strong>I.    General</strong></p>
        <p>
          A.    A Page for a brand, entity (place or organization), or public figure may be administered only by an
          authorized representative of that brand, entity (place or organization) or public figure (an “official Page”).
        </p>
        <p>
          B.    Any user may create a Page to express support for or interest in a brand, entity (place or
          organization), or public figure, provided that it does not mislead others into thinking it is an official
          Page, or violate someone's rights. If your Page is not the official Page of a brand, entity (place or
          organization) or public figure, you must:
        </p>
        <p>
          i.    not speak in the voice of, or post content as though it was coming from, the authorized representative
          of the Page’s subject matter; and
        </p>
        <p>
          ii.    make clear that the Page is not the official Page of the brand, entity (place or organization) or
          public figure.
        </p>
        <p>C.    Content posted to a Page is public and viewable by everyone who can see the Page.</p>
        <p>
          D.    You are required to restrict access to Pages (through our gating functionality) as necessary to comply
          with applicable laws and Facebook policies, including our
          <a href="https://www.facebook.com/communitystandards">Community Standards</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          E.    You may not establish terms for your Page that conflict with our
          <a href="https://www.facebook.com/legal/terms">Statement of Rights and Responsibilities</a>,
          <a href="https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/">Data Policy</a> or these terms.
        </p>
        <p>F.    Do not misuse Facebook’s upload functionality.</p>
        <p><strong>II.    Page Management</strong></p>
        <p>A.    <strong>Page Names and Facebook Web Addresses</strong></p>
        <p>
          Page names and Facebook Web Addresses must accurately reflect Page content. We may remove administrative
          rights or require you to change the Page name and Facebook Web Address for any Page that fails to meet this
          requirement.
        </p>
        <p>Page names must:</p>
        <p>i.    not consist solely of generic terms (e.g., “beer” or “pizza”);</p>
        <p>
          ii.    use proper, grammatically correct capitalization and may not include all capitals, except for acronyms;
        </p>
        <p>iii.    not include character symbols, such as excessive punctuation and trademark designations;</p>
        <p>iv.    not include superfluous descriptions or unnecessary qualifiers;</p>
        <p>
          v.    not mislead others into thinking it is an official Page of the Page’s subject matter or is authorized by
          an authorized representative of the Page’s subject matter; and
        </p>
        <p>vi.    not violate someone’s rights.</p>
        <p>B.    <strong>Name Changes and Merges</strong></p>
        <p>
          Name changes and merges must not result in a misleading or unintended connection and must not substantially
          change the Page’s subject matter. Additionally, you must not request a name change or merge that would result
          in re-categorizing a product Page to a brand Page, a generic or opinion Page to a brand Page, or a Group to a
          Page.
        </p>
        <p>C.    <strong>Collection of Data</strong></p>
        <p>
          A.    If you collect content and information directly from users, you will make it clear that you (and not
          Facebook) are collecting it, and you will provide notice about and obtain user consent for your use of the
          content and information that you collect. Regardless of how you obtain content and information from users, you
          are responsible for securing all necessary permissions to reuse their content and information.
        </p>
        <p>
          B.    You will not collect users' content or information, or otherwise access Facebook, using automated means
          (such as harvesting bots, robots, spiders, or scrapers) without our permission.
        </p>
        <p>
          C.    Don’t use information obtained from a person’s interaction with your call-to-action for any purpose
          other than to provide the service associated with the call-to-action. If you want to use this information for
          any other purpose, first obtain a person’s explicit consent.
        </p>
        <p>D.    <strong>Tagging</strong></p>
        <p>
          You must not inaccurately tag content or encourage users to inaccurately tag content (ex: don’t encourage
          people to tag themselves in photos if they aren’t in the photo).
        </p>
        <p><strong>III.    Page Features</strong></p>
        <p>A.    <strong>Branded Content on Pages</strong></p>
        <p>
          1. Branded content must comply with our
          <a href="https://www.facebook.com/policies/brandedcontent/">Branded Content Policies</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. You must comply with all applicable laws and regulations, including by ensuring that you provide all
          necessary disclosures to people using Facebook, such as any disclosures needed to indicate the commercial
          nature of content posted by you.
        </p>
        <p>B.    <strong>Cover</strong></p>
        <p>
          All covers are public. This means that anyone who visits your Page will be able to see your cover. Covers
          can't be deceptive, misleading, or infringe on anyone else's copyright. You may not encourage people to upload
          your cover to their personal timelines.
        </p>
        <p>C.    <strong>Applications on Pages</strong></p>
        <p>
          Apps on your Page must comply with the
          <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/policy/">Facebook Platform Policies</a>.
        </p>
        <p>D.    <strong>Offers</strong></p>
        <p>If you create an offer using Facebook’s offer creation tool, the following policies apply:</p>
        <p>i.    Facebook offers must be available for a limited time.</p>
        <p>
          ii.    You may only run an offer if you are the merchant for or the manufacturer of the product or service you
          are promoting.
        </p>
        <p>
          iii.    You must clearly and prominently disclose any restrictions on your offer (such as expiration date or
          limitations on redemption).
        </p>
        <p>
          iv.    You are solely responsible for improper redemption, fraud, disputes or other issues that arise from the
          distribution and/or redemption of your offer.
        </p>
        <p>
          v.    If your offer may be redeemed at a merchant not operated by you, it is your sole responsibility to
          communicate with the merchant and ensure they honor your offer.
        </p>
        <p>
          vi.    You must only use the offer creation tool for its intended functionality and not to promote your
          website or other contact information, or to offer the equivalent of a gift card, gift certificate or stored
          value card.
        </p>
        <p>
          vii.    You are responsible for ensuring that your offer complies with these terms and all applicable laws,
          rules and regulations. Offers are subject to many regulations (such as alcohol discounts and offers marketed
          to minors) and if you are not certain that your offer complies with applicable law, consult with an expert.
        </p>
        <p>E.    <a></a><strong>Promotions</strong></p>
        <p>
          1. If you use Facebook to communicate or administer a promotion (ex: a contest or sweepstakes), you are
          responsible for the lawful operation of that promotion, including:
        </p>
        <p>a.   The official rules;</p>
        <p>b.   Offer terms and eligibility requirements (ex: age and residency restrictions); and</p>
        <p>
          c.   Compliance with applicable rules and regulations governing the promotion and all prizes offered (ex:
          registration and obtaining necessary regulatory approvals)
        </p>
        <p>2. Promotions on Facebook must include the following:</p>
        <p>a.   A complete release of Facebook by each entrant or participant.</p>
        <p>
          b.   Acknowledgement that the promotion is in no way sponsored, endorsed or administered by, or associated
          with, Facebook.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Promotions may be administered on Pages or within apps on Facebook. Personal Timelines and friend
          connections must not be used to administer promotions (ex: “share on your Timeline to enter” or “share on your
          friend's Timeline to get additional entries”, and "tag your friends in this post to enter" are not permitted).
        </p>
        <p>
          4. We will not assist you in the administration of your promotion, and you agree that if you use our service
          to administer your promotion, you do so at your own risk.
        </p>
