        <h2>2. General Policies for Facebook Live</h2>
        <p><strong>Prohibited Practices</strong></p>
        <p>
          Facebook Live must not be used to mislead users that specific footage is occurring in real time when it is
          not.
        </p>
        <p>Example:</p>
        <p></p>
        <li>Misrepresenting footage of an event that occurred a year ago as currently happening</li>
        <p></p>
        <p><strong>Inaccurate Location</strong></p>
        <p>
          Facebook Live must not be used to mislead users that specific footage is happening in a particular locale when
          it is not.
        </p>
        <p>Example:</p>
        <p></p>
        <li>Misrepresenting footage from a different country as footage from the United States</li>
        <p></p>
        <p><strong>Pre-recorded Content</strong></p>
        <p>
          All pre-recorded content contained in a broadcast streamed to Facebook Live must be clearly marked as
          pre-recorded. For broadcasts that contain a mixture of live footage and pre-recorded footage, only the
          pre-recorded footage must be marked as pre-recorded.
        </p>
        <p>Example:</p>
        <p></p>
        <li>Adding a graphic to mark specific footage as pre-recorded</li>
        <p></p>
        <p></p>
        <li>Including a disclaimer in the video description or title that specific content is pre-recorded</li>
        <p></p>
        <p><strong>Looping or Static Content</strong></p>
        <p>Facebook Live should not be used to broadcast looping videos, static images, or poll-only videos.</p>
        <p>Example:</p>
        <p></p>
        <li>Streaming a 20-minute clip that is continuously looped</li>
        <p></p>
        <p></p>
        <li>A broadcast that is limited to a photo and has no other auditory or visual elements</li>
        <p></p>
        <p></p>
        <li>A broadcast that only contains a poll</li>
