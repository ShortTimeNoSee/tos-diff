        <ul>
          <li>Browser and app logs of your visits to public content, like Facebook Pages and videos</li>
          <li>
            Basic information about <a href="#annotation-10" target="_self">devices[10]</a> that downloaded our apps,
            like device model and OS
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          We also receive information using cookies and similar technologies, like the Meta Pixel or Social Plugins,

          <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/331509497253087/?helpref=uf_share" target="_blank">Business Tools</a>
          or other Meta Products. Read more about information we receive from partners, vendors and other third parties

        </p>
        <h2>Examples of why we collect and receive information</h2>
        <h3>Security of our Products</h3>
        <p>
          For example, we collect information to monitor attempted attacks on our systems, such as overloading our
          servers with traffic. Also, if we see someone without an account trying to load too many pages, they could be
          trying to
          <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/463983701520800/?helpref=search" target="_blank">scrape</a> our site in
          violation of our terms. Then we can take action to prevent it.
        </p>
        <h3>Safety and integrity</h3>
        <p>
          For example, if someone without an account joins a room and shares a harmful video, we can take action
          according to our Community Standards. We can remove content that violates our terms and policies, or share
          information with law enforcement when we believe there is a genuine risk of death or imminent bodily harm.
        </p>
        <h3>Advertising</h3>
        <p>
          For example, you may also see ads for the Meta Company Products shown through
          <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/119468292028768/?helpref=search" target="_blank"
            >Meta Audience Network</a
          >
          when you visit other apps if we can’t recognize you as a registered user of the Meta Products.
        </p>
        <h3>Performance</h3>
        <p>
          For example, we collect information when people use our Products, even if they don’t have an account, to
          measure how fast our pages load in different countries and whether they're working properly. This helps us
          identify and fix issues with local networks.
        </p>
        5
        <h2>Information you provide</h2>
        <p>
          For example, when you create a Facebook account, you must provide some information, like a password and your
          email address or phone number. You might choose to add other details to your account, like a profile photo or
          payment information.
        </p>
        <p>We also collect information you provide when you:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Create your avatar</li>
          <li>Fill out a form</li>
          <li>Contact us</li>
        </ul>
        6
        <h2>What we collect from our camera feature</h2>
        <p>
          José likes using Instagram’s Camera feature to take pictures of his flower garden. We collect information
          about how José uses the Camera feature. For example, if he chooses a background effect for the photo he’s
          about to take, we collect information from the camera so we can apply the effect to his photo.
        </p>
        <h2>How filters, effects, masks and avatars work</h2>
        <p>
          If you use our camera or allow access to photos and videos, on certain Meta Products you can add filters,
          effects, masks or avatars. Some of these features process parts of faces or bodies within the camera frame,
          photo or video. Then they can do things like fit a mask correctly over the eyes, nose and mouth. The
          information we use for this process is used to create the feature. It’s not used to identify you.
        </p>
        <h2>What we collect from voice-enabled features</h2>
        <p>
          Ren tells Meta’s voice-enabled Assistant to take a photo on smart glasses. A visual indicator shows that
          Assistant is activated and listening for Ren’s command. We collect this voice interaction, which includes any
          background sound that occurs when Ren says the command. Collecting Ren’s voice interactions lets us provide
          and, depending on Ren’s settings, improve the Assistant feature.
        </p>
        7
        <h2>Metadata</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Information about the content itself, like the location where a photo was taken or the date a file was
            created
          </li>
          <li>Information about the message itself, like the type of message or the date and time it was sent</li>
        </ul>
        8
        <h2>Apps and features you use, and how you use them</h2>
        <p>For example, we log:</p>
        <ul>

            What apps, posts, videos, ads, games, Shops and other content you view or interact with on our Products

          <li>What features you access from our messaging products</li>

        <ul>
          <li>Share or comment on a photo you’re tagged in</li>
          <li>Send you a message</li>

          <li>Block or report you</li>
        </ul>
        12
        <h2>What device you’re using, and other device characteristics</h2>

        <h2>Identifiers that tell your device apart from other users’</h2>
        <p>
          Identifiers we collect include device IDs, mobile advertiser ID or IDs from games, apps or accounts you use.
          We also collect Family Device IDs or other identifiers unique to
          <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/195227921252400?ref=dp" target="_blank">Meta Company Products</a>
          associated with the same device or account.

        14
        <h2>Device signals</h2>
        <p>Device signals include GPS, Bluetooth signals, nearby Wi-Fi access points, beacons and cell towers.</p>
        15
        <h2>Related metadata</h2>
        <p>
          For example, if you give us permission to access your device’s camera roll, we collect metadata. This metadata
          is from and about your photos and videos and includes the date and time they were made. We use this to do
          things like remind you when you have new photos to upload.
        </p>
        16
        <h2>IP address</h2>
        <p>
          Stands for "internet protocol address." It’s a unique number assigned to a device, like a phone or computer,
          that allows it to communicate over the internet. Numbers are assigned according to standard guidelines, or
          protocols.
        </p>
        <p>
          Just like you need a mailing address to receive a letter from a friend, your device needs an IP address to
          receive information on the internet.
        </p>
        17
        <h2>Information about the network you connect your device to and your internet connection</h2>

          <li>Language</li>
          <li>Time zone</li>
          <li>Mobile phone number</li>
          <li>IP address</li>
          <li>Connection and download speed</li>
          <li>Network capability</li>
          <li>Information about other devices that are nearby or on your network</li>
          <li>Wi-Fi hotspots you connect to using our Products</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          One reason we collect this information is to make your experience better. For example, if we know that your
          phone and TV are connected to the same network, we can help you use your phone to control a video stream on
          your TV.

          partners understand and measure how people are using their products and services and how well their ads are
          working. For example, they might put one of our Business Tools, the Meta Pixel, on their website. Or they

        <h2>To provide, personalize and improve our Products</h2>
        <p>
          We use information we have to provide and improve our
          <a href="#annotation-28" target="_self">Products[28]</a>. This includes personalizing features, content and
          <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/1257205004624246" target="_blank">recommendations</a>, such as your

          or commercial content when you visit other apps. We use your information to show you ads paid for by
          advertisers, businesses, and organizations. We want everything you see to be interesting and useful to you.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>See if a product is working correctly</li>
          <li>Troubleshoot and fix it when it’s not</li>

        <a></a>
        <h2>How we use location-related information</h2>
        <p>
          We use location-related information that you allow us to receive if you turn on the Location Services device
          setting. This includes things like your GPS location and, depending on the operating system you're using,
          other <a href="#annotation-31" target="_self">device signals[31]</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          We also receive and use some location-related information even if Location Services is turned off. This
          includes:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <a href="#annotation-32" target="_self">IP addresses[32]</a>, which we use to estimate your general
            location. We can use IP addresses to estimate your specific location if it’s necessary to protect the safety
            and security of you or others.
          </li>
          <li>Your and others' activity on our Products, like check-ins and events</li>

            address in Marketplace
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          We use location-related information, such as your current location, where you live, the places you like to go
          and the businesses and people you're near, to do the things described in the
          <a href="#2-HowDoWeUse">“How do we use your information?” section of the Policy</a>, like:

            Our reviewers help us promote safety, security and integrity across our Products. For example, reviewers can

            We also use manual review to analyze content to train our algorithms to review content the same way a person

        <h2>What Products does this Policy cover?</h2>
        <p>
          This Policy describes the information we, Meta Platforms, Inc., process to provide
          <a href="https://www.facebook.com/legal/meta-products" target="_blank">Meta Products</a>, which we also call
          "Products."
        </p>

        <h2>How we personalize your Facebook Feed</h2>
        <p>
          Your Facebook Feed is unique to you. We order (or “rank”) the content you can see in your Feed, and you can
          <a href="https://transparency.fb.com/en-gb/features/ranking-and-content/" target="_blank">learn more</a> about
          the different types of signals we use to rank it. We also suggest content that’s relevant to you.
        </p>
        <p>Many things influence the content you see in your Feed.</p>
        <p>For example:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            If your friends, connections or people you may know interact with a Facebook Page, post or certain topic, we
            can suggest similar content to you. So if your friend Ahmad comments on a post about national parks, we can
            suggest the national parks post to you.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you and others interact with the same group, Facebook Page or post, we can suggest another group, Page or
            post that they interact with for you. So if you and Sharmila are in the same cat lovers group and Sharmila
            likes a Page that sells scarves, we might suggest the scarves Page to you.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you’ve recently engaged with a certain topic on Facebook, we might then suggest other posts that are
            related to that topic. So if you recently liked or commented on a post from a basketball Page, we could
            suggest other posts about basketball.
          </li>
          <li>
            You might see posts based on where you are and what people near you are interacting with on Facebook. So if
            you’re near a sports stadium, we can suggest games or events occurring at the stadium.
            <a href="#2.subpage.6-HowWeUseLocation">Learn more</a> about how we use location-related information.

        ><a href="https://mbasic.facebook.com/feed_preferences/home/">Manage Facebook Feed</a>30
        <h2>Your activity on our Products</h2>
        <p>
          For example, William checks into a local bakery on Facebook, so later we might show him ads on Instagram for
          other local bakeries.
        </p>
        <h2>Your activity on third-party websites and apps, depending on your settings</h2>
        <p>
          For example, Jane buys a pair of shoes from an online shoe store or in an online chat with a shoe seller. The
          seller shares Jane’s activity with us using our Business Tools, subject to our Business Tools Terms.
        </p>
        <p>Later, Jane sees an ad on Instagram for a discount on her next shoe purchase from the online store.</p>
        <p>
          If she doesn't want to see ads from this shoe store again, she can hide them in her
          <a href="https://www.facebook.com/adpreferences/advertisers" target="_blank">Advertisers setting</a>. Or if
          she doesn’t want us to show her any ads based on her activity on other websites and apps, she can make sure
          that this setting is turned off in her
          <a href="https://www.facebook.com/adpreferences/ad_settings" target="_blank">Ad preferences</a>.
        </p>
        <h2>Topics we think you might be interested in</h2>
        <p>
          For example, Jon likes several Facebook Pages about famous musicians, so we think he has an interest in
          "music."
        </p>
        <p>Based on this interest, we might show him an ad for a local record shop or an online music publication.</p>
        <p>
          Jon can manage his interests in his
          <a href="https://www.facebook.com/adpreferences/ad_topics" target="_blank">ad topics</a>.
        </p>
        <h2>Your connections</h2>
        <p>
          For example, Fiona’s friend likes an Instagram account for a local art fair. Based on her friend’s activity,
          we might show Fiona an ad for the art fair.
        </p>
        31
        <h2>Other device signals we receive</h2>
        <p>
          We receive different types of device signals from different operating systems. They include things like nearby
          Bluetooth or Wi-Fi connections.
        </p>
        32
        <h2>IP address</h2>
        <p>
          Stands for "internet protocol address." It’s a unique number assigned to a device, like a phone or computer,
          that allows it to communicate over the internet. Numbers are assigned according to standard guidelines, or
          protocols.
        </p>
        <p>
          Just like you need a mailing address to receive a letter from a friend, your device needs an IP address to
          receive information on the internet.
        </p>
        33
        <h2>Personalizing ads for you and others</h2>
        <p>
          For example, Marcus is going on a trip and wants to use Find Wi-Fi to find free, public Wi-Fi at the airport.
          He has turned on Location Services on his device and allowed location access on the Facebook app, so we can
          use his GPS information to help him find the most relevant public Wi-Fi networks. We’ll also use this
          information to show him ads for local businesses near the airport.
        </p>
        <p>
          Later, Marcus turns off Location Services before he lands, so we don’t collect his GPS information anymore.
          Later on his trip, he opens the Facebook app, and we can use the IP address we receive to estimate Marcus’
          general location and show him ads for businesses nearby.
        </p>
        34
        <h2>Helping to keep your account secure</h2>
        <p>
          For example, we use information about the locations you normally log in from, combined with other information,
          to detect suspicious activity. So if we detect an attempt to log into your account from a new location, we can
          check that it’s really you.
        </p>
        35
        <h2>Partner</h2>
        <p>
          A person, business, organization or body using or integrating our Products to advertise, market or support
          their products and services
        </p>
        36
        <h2>Information we provide about different types of people</h2>
        <p>
          For example, we might tell an advertiser that their ad was seen by women aged 25–34 who live in Madrid and
          like software engineering.
        </p>
        37
        <h2>Third party</h2>
        <p>A person, business, organization or body that is not part of the Meta Companies</p>
        38
        <h2>Providing more personalized features, content and suggestions across our Products</h2>
        <p>For example we can:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Automatically fill in registration information, like your phone number, from one Meta Product when you sign
            up for an account on a different Product
          </li>
          <li>Let others see and search your name and profile photo across our Products and communicate with you</li>
          <li>Show all interactions in one place for content you’ve cross-posted to different Products</li>
        </ul>
        39
        <h2>Using your information if you add accounts to the same Accounts Center</h2>
        <p>
          For example, if you follow your favorite team on Instagram, we can more easily suggest that you follow that
          team’s Page on Facebook.
        </p>

        <h2>Service provider</h2>
        <p>
          A person, business, organization or body that provides services to Meta or to our users on behalf of Meta. For
          example, our service providers do things like investigate suspicious activity and provide customer support.

          <li>You can choose to share information on our Products or with integrated partners</li>
          <li>Remember to share only with people you trust</li>
          <li>
            You might decide to use a product that integrates with one of ours, like if you use Facebook Login to log

          </li>
          <li>
            If you do, that organization will ask you to receive some information about you, like your email address or

        <h2>People and accounts you share and communicate with</h2>
        <p>
          When you share and communicate using our Products, you can sometimes
          <a href="#annotation-43" target="_self">choose the audience[43]</a> for what you share.
        </p>
        <p>When you interact with people or businesses, they can see:</p>
        <h2>What you share with them</h2>
        <p>For example, the audience you choose can see when you:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Share a post you’ve written</li>
          <li>Share a photo or video</li>
          <li>Create a story</li>
          <li>Share a news article</li>
          <li>Add information to your profile</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>What you communicate with them</h2>
        <p>
          People you interact with can see what you send to them. So if you send a person or a business a message on
          Messenger or Instagram, that person or business can read your message.
        </p>
        <h2>Some of your activity</h2>
        <p>People and businesses can also see some of your activity on our Products. This includes when you:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Comment on or react to others’ posts</li>
          <li>Engage with ads or other sponsored or commercial content, like by commenting or liking</li>
          <li>Allow content you've shared about a product in a Shop to be shared across our Products</li>

        </ul>
        <h2>When you’re active</h2>
        <p>
          Some of our Products might provide you with settings that allow others to see when you're active on our
          Products, such as “active status.” In some cases, we also offer settings that allow others to see when you’re
          active in a particular section of one of our Products, like a message thread, game or event, or when you last
          used one of our Products.

        <h2>When you interact with a supervised user</h2>
        <p>
          Some accounts are <a href="#annotation-44" target="_self">supervised[44]</a>. When you interact with a
          supervised user, their parent or guardian can see some of your activity and information. This can include
          information like your username, profile picture and if the supervised user blocked you. On some Products, the
          supervised user can let their parent or guardian know if they reported you.
        </p>
        <a></a>
        <h2>Content others share or reshare about you</h2>
        <h2>Who can see or reshare your content</h2>
        <p>
          People in your audience can view your content and can choose to share it with others outside your audience, on
          and off our Products. For example, when you share a post or send a message to specific friends, they can
          download, screenshot or reshare it with anyone, on, across or off our Products.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you comment on a post or react to a photo, your comment or reaction can be seen by anyone who can see the
          post or photo. This can include people you aren’t connected to. The person who shared the post can also change
          their audience at any time after you’ve interacted with it.
        </p>
        <h2>How information about you can be shared</h2>
        <p>
          People who use our Products can share information about you with the audience they choose. For example, they
          can:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Share a photo or video of you in a post, comment, story, reel or message</li>

          Other content you can choose to set to Public, like posts, photos and videos you post to your profile, Stories

        <h2>Who can see public content?</h2>
        <p>
          When content is public, it can be seen by anyone on or across our Products, and in some cases off our
          Products, even if they don’t have an account.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, if you comment on Marketplace, a Facebook Page or a public Instagram account, or if you leave a
          rating or review, your comment, rating or review will be visible to anyone. It could appear in any of our
          Products or be seen by anyone, including off our Products.
        </p>
        <h2>Where can public content be shared?</h2>

          requests to access information are separate from the Apps and Websites access that you manage in your Facebook
          or Instagram Ad settings or in your mobile device settings.
        </p>
        <h2>How long they can access your information</h2>
        <p>
          Apps or websites you’ve logged into using Facebook Login or connected to your Instagram account can access
          your nonpublic information on Meta Products unless it appears to us that you haven’t used the app or website
          in 90 days. Note that even if an app’s access to your information has expired, it can still retain information
          you shared with it previously.
        </p>
        <p>
          We encourage you to visit your Apps and Websites settings from time to time to review which apps and websites
          continue to have access to your information through Facebook Login or Instagram.

        <h2>When you interact with someone else’s content on an integrated partner’s product or service</h2>
        <p>
          Integrated partners receive information about your activity when you interact with other Facebook, Instagram
          or Messenger users while they’re using the integrated partner’s product or service.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, a gamer livestreams to Facebook using a partner app. Then you comment on that livestream. The app
          developer will receive information about your comment.
        </p>
        <a></a>
        <h2>How integrated partners handle your information</h2>
        <p>
          Integrated partners handle the information you share with them according to their own terms and policies, not
          Meta’s. You can review their privacy policy on their website or app to learn how they receive and process your
          information. In some cases, they use a separate service provider to receive and process your information.

        <h2>What Products does this Policy cover?</h2>
        <p>
          This Policy describes the information we, Meta Platforms, Inc., process to provide
          <a href="https://www.facebook.com/legal/meta-products" target="_blank">Meta Products</a>, which we also call
          "Products."
        </p>
        43
        <h2>Choosing an audience</h2>
        <p>On Facebook, the audience can be made up of:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The public, including people on and off Facebook</li>
          <li>Your friends and other connections, such as the friends of people you tag</li>
          <li>A customized list of people</li>
          <li>Yourself</li>
          <li>The members of a single community, such as a group</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          On Instagram, you can set the audience for what you share by choosing between a private or public account.
          With a <a href="https://help.instagram.com/448523408565555" target="_blank">private account</a>, only
          followers you approve can see what you share. With a public account, your posts and other content on Instagram
          can be seen by anyone, on or off our Products, including if they don’t have an account. You can restrict the
          audience for your content by blocking individual accounts from viewing them. You can also create a close
          friends list for certain types of content that only the people on that list can see.

        <h2>Supervision</h2>
        <p>
          Supervision provides supervisors chosen by a teen, like parents and guardians, with tools and insights to help
          support a teen account.
        </p>
        45
        <h2>Search engines</h2>
        <p>
          You can visit your
          <a href="https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=privacy" target="_blank">privacy settings</a> to control
          whether search engines can show your profile or public photos and videos in search results outside of Meta.
          Some public content might still be accessible through search engines, for example:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>If you post with your audience or profile set to Public,</li>
          <li>If you post on public Pages or accounts, depending on the settings of that account,</li>
          <li>If your public content is reshared by a professional account on Instagram.</li>
        </ul>
        46
        <h2>Integrated partner</h2>
        <p>
          A partner who uses technologies that help you make a connection to them through our Products, including
          plugins, login, checkout experiences, instant games, and other such integrations
        </p>
        47
        <h2>When an integrated partner might receive your information</h2>
        <p>
          For example, you might use your Facebook login to play an online game with your Facebook friends. The game
          developer automatically receives information about your activities in the game.
        </p>
        <h2>When an integrated partner might receive your information</h2>
        <p>
          Or you might use the Facebook Like button on an article posted on a news website. The website developer
          automatically receives information about your Like on their article.
        </p>
        48
        <h2>Sharing friends lists</h2>
        <h3>When you share your friends list</h3>
        <p>
          If you use Facebook Login to log into an app, the app developer might request access to your list of Facebook
          friends. Here's what happens if you give the app developer permission to view these lists:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            They can view and access a list of your Facebook friends who use the same app and have given the app
            permission to access their list of friends. They can’t access nonpublic information about your friends or
            followers through this process. Note that the app developer will receive more information about your friends
            if your friends choose to share it themselves. They can share it by providing the information directly or
            giving the developer permission to access information from their account.
          </li>
          <li>
            You’ll appear on friends lists that your Facebook friends can choose to share with the same app. You can
            remove this permission, or the app entirely, if you later decide that you don’t want to share your friends
            list with an app, or don’t want to appear on other friends lists shared with that app.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>When your friends share their friends list</h3>
        <p>
          Your friends might choose to share their friends lists with app developers through Facebook Login. But your
          friends can’t use Facebook Login to share nonpublic information about you.

        <h1>How do we share information with third parties?</h1>
        <h2>Highlights</h2>
        <p>We share certain information with:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Advertisers who show ads on our Products</li>
          <li>Businesses we hire to market our Products for us</li>
          <li>Businesses we hire to do things like offer customer service or conduct surveys</li>
          <li>Researchers who use it to do things like innovate, advance technology, or improve people’s safety</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We don’t sell your information, and we never will.</p>
        <p>
          We don't sell any of your information to anyone, and we never will. We also require
          <a href="#annotation-49" target="_self">partners[49]</a> and other
          <a href="#annotation-50" target="_self">third parties[50]</a> to follow rules about how they can and cannot
          use and disclose the information we provide.
        </p>
        <p>Here’s more detail about who we share information with:</p>
        <h2>Partners</h2>
        <a></a>
        <h2>Advertisers and Audience Network publishers</h2>
        <h3>Advertisers</h3>
        <p>
          We provide advertisers with reports about the number and kinds of people who see and engage with their ads and
          commercial content. These reports include information about the general demographics and interests of people
          who engaged with an advertiser’s ad or commercial content. Then advertisers can better understand their
          audience. <a href="#annotation-51" target="_self">See an example[51]</a>.
        </p>
        <p>Meta also provides advertisers and their vendors with information about:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Ads and commercial content people engaged with, if any</li>
          <li>When people engaged with ads and commercial content</li>
          <li>Where that ad or commercial content was shown (for example, on Instagram, or on Facebook)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          We also confirm which ads or commercial content you viewed that led you to take an action with an advertiser,
          such as downloading an advertiser's app. But we don't share information with these advertisers and their
          vendors that by itself can be used to contact or identify you, such as your name or email address, unless you
          <a href="#annotation-52" target="_self">give us permission.[52]</a>
        </p>
        <h3>Audience Network publishers and their vendors</h3>
        <p>
          Meta Audience Network lets advertisers place ads with us that will be published on other apps and websites
          outside of Meta.
        </p>
        <p>
          To help show you ads on their apps and websites, we share information with publishers who use Audience
          Network, as well as vendors who facilitate that use. For example, we share:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>How many people see and engage with ads on publisher apps</li>
          <li>
            Information related to or in response to a
            <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/119468292028768?ref=shareable" target="_blank"
              >publisher’s request</a
            >
            to serve an ad on its app.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          But we don't share information with these publishers and their vendors that by itself can be used to contact
          or identify you, such as your name or email address, unless you
          <a href="#annotation-52" target="_self">give us permission[52]</a>.
        </p>
        <a></a>
        <h2>Partners who use our analytics services</h2>
        <p>
          People rely on our <a href="#annotation-53" target="_self">Products[53]</a>, like business accounts,
          professional tools and Facebook Pages, to run and promote their businesses. Businesses use our analytics
          services to understand more about how people are using their content, features, products and services.
        </p>
        <p>
          To provide these services, we use the <a href="#1-WhatInformationDoWe">information we collect</a> about you.
          We put this information into aggregate reports so that partners can see how well their content, features,
          products and services are performing and are able to understand things like users’ experience with such
          content, products and services.
        </p>
        <p>These reports aggregate information like:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>How many people interacted with our partners' content, products or services</li>
          <li>
            The <a href="#annotation-51" target="_self">general demographics and interests[51]</a> of the people who
            interacted with it
          </li>
          <li>
            How people use our partners’ products and services to connect to Meta Products and the performance of their
            connection and networks
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Advertisers also receive other information.
          <a href="#4.subpage.2-AdvertisersAndAudienceNetwork">Read our Policy</a> about how we share information with
          advertisers.
        </p>
        <a></a>
        <h2>Partners who offer goods or services on our Products and commerce services platforms</h2>
        <p>
          When you choose to <a href="#annotation-54" target="_self">make a transaction[54]</a>, or otherwise choose to
          share information with a seller, creator, fundraiser, charity, payment services provider or
          <a href="#annotation-55" target="_self">commerce services platform[55]</a>, we share information with them and
          with any providers acting on their behalf.
        </p>
        <p>Depending on how you interact with them, they receive:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Information to complete your transaction, like order, payment, contact and shipping information</li>
          <li>
            Information to help ensure the security of the transaction, like information about your device or connection
          </li>
          <li>Any information required by applicable regulation</li>
          <li>Other information you choose to share with them</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          For example, if you make a purchase from an Instagram shop using checkout, the shop will receive information
          to complete your transaction. This may include your order items, your contact details and shipping
          information. If the shop uses a payment services provider, such as PayPal, to facilitate the transaction, the
          provider will receive the transaction amount, a transaction description (to appear on your credit card
          statement) and your payment card information, such as cardholder name, card number, expiration date and
          billing address.

        <h2>Integrated partners</h2>
        <p>
          When you choose to use integrated partners’ products or services, they may receive information about you and
          your activity. <a href="#3.subpage.4-WhenYouUseAn">Read the Policy</a>.
        </p>
        <h2>Vendors</h2>
        <a></a>
        <h2>Measurement vendors</h2>
        <p>We don’t create every measurement and analytics report ourselves.</p>
        <p>
          We share information (like whether people saw an ad or engaged with it) with our
          <a href="#annotation-56" target="_self">measurement vendors[56]</a>, who aggregate or compile it to provide
          their reports.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, an advertiser might ask a measurement vendor to help figure out the impact its ads on Facebook
          have had on sales. The measurement vendor compares information from us about clicks on the advertiser’s
          Facebook ads with information from the advertiser about product purchases. Then the measurement vendor creates
          and provides aggregated reports that show the advertiser how its ads are performing.
        </p>
        <a></a>
        <h2>Marketing vendors</h2>
        <p>
          We share information about you with <a href="#annotation-57" target="_self">marketing vendors[57]</a>. For
          example, we share your device identifier or other identifiers with marketing vendors to help us serve you ads
          most relevant to your interests.
        </p>
        <p>Marketing vendors support our marketing and advertising efforts by:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Serving our advertisements across the internet, including on mobile, desktop and connected television
            devices
          </li>
          <li>Tracking and categorizing your online and mobile app activity</li>
          <li>Providing us information about your interests and community and advertising interactions</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          These marketing vendors help us understand who might find our advertising most relevant to their interests,
          and which of our Products might interest you. This information can be used to personalize which of our ads are
          shown to you. Marketing vendors also use this information to measure response to our marketing efforts and the
          effectiveness of our advertising.

        <h2>AI integrations</h2>
        <p>
          Generative AI models that make our features work may not have the most complete or recent information. That
          means if you ask Meta AI about the score to yesterday's football game, it might not know the right answer.
          That's why we work with other trusted companies, like search engine providers, so we can bring you the most
          relevant information.

        <p>
          Meta sometimes shares the messages you send to our AIs and general information, like your region, with these

          unless you include it in your messages to the AIs.

          And if we sell or transfer all or part of our business to someone else, in some cases we’ll give the new owner
          your information as part of that transaction, but only as the law allows.

        <h2>Partner</h2>
        <p>
          A person, business, organization or body using or integrating our Products to advertise, market or support
          their products and services
        </p>
        50
        <h2>Third party</h2>
        <p>A person, business, organization or body that is not part of the Meta Companies</p>
        51
        <h2>General demographics and interests</h2>
        <p>
          For example, a bike shop creates a Page on Facebook and wants to place an ad to reach an audience of people in
          Atlanta interested in cycling. We determine whether someone fits in this audience based on, for example,
          whether they liked a Page about bikes. Then people in that audience could see the bike shop's ad.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can see the “interests” assigned to you in your
          <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ads/preferences/" target="_blank">Ad preferences</a> and remove them if you
          want.
        </p>
        <p>
          The bike shop can then see reports showing aggregated statistics about the audience seeing their ads and how
          their ads are performing. The reports would show statistics to the advertiser that, for example, most of the
          people who saw or clicked on their ad:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Were women</li>
          <li>Were between the ages of 25 and 34</li>
          <li>Clicked on the ad from their phone</li>
        </ul>
        52
        <h2>When you might give us permission</h2>
        <p>
          For example, you might request more information from a business by clicking their ad in your Facebook Feed and
          submitting a form with your name and contact information. Then the advertiser would receive the information
          you provided.

        <h2>Service provider</h2>
        <p>
          A person, business, organization or body that provides services to Meta or to our users on behalf of Meta. For
          example, our service providers do things like investigate suspicious activity and provide customer support.
        </p>
        61
        <h2>Why we share across the Meta Companies</h2>
        <h3>Promoting safety, security and integrity and complying with applicable law</h3>
        <p>
          For example, we share information with Meta Companies that provide financial products and services to help
          them promote safety, security and integrity and comply with applicable law. This includes:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Complying with their legal obligations</li>
          <li>Helping keep you and others safe</li>
          <li>Performing account verification</li>
          <li>Investigating suspicious activities</li>
          <li>Creating analytics</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          For these purposes, we might share your name, email address, who you’re friends with and other account
          information within the Meta Companies.
        </p>
        <h3>Developing and providing features and integrations</h3>
        <p>
          For example, where available in your country, you can choose to use certain integrations that connect your
          WhatsApp experiences with other Meta Company Products. These integrations let you do things like:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Use your Meta Pay account to pay for things on WhatsApp</li>
          <li>
            Chat with your friends on other Meta Company Products, such as smart glasses, by connecting your WhatsApp
            account
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          We also share information with Meta Companies to support innovation. For example, your videos can help train
          our products to recognize objects, like trees, or activities, like when a dog chases a ball. They can also
          help train tools that let people and businesses create content, like images and videos. This technology is
          used to help us offer new products or features in the future.
        </p>
        <h3>Understanding how people use our products</h3>
        <p>
          We count the number of unique users, monthly active users and daily active users on our products. This
          information helps us understand the community using our products and publicly share important trends about how
          our products are used.

            If we need it for other legitimate purposes, such as to prevent harm; investigate possible violations of our
            terms or policies; promote safety, security and integrity; or protect ourselves, including our rights,
            property or products
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          In some instances and for specific reasons, we’ll keep information for an extended period of time.

        <h2>If we need it to operate or provide our Products</h2>
        <p>
          For example, we keep profile information, photos you’ve posted (and not deleted) and security information for
          the lifetime of your account.
        </p>
        <p>
          And when you search for something on Facebook, we keep your search history until you clear the search in your
          <a href="https://www.facebook.com/0/allactivity" target="_blank">activity log</a> or delete your account. Once
          you clear a search or delete your account, it will no longer be visible to you, and it will be
          <a href="#annotation-69" target="_self">deleted[69]</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          But even if you don’t clear your search or delete your account, within six months of your search we delete
          information about that search that isn’t necessary to show you your search history, like information about the
          device you were using, or your location.

        <h2>The feature we use it for, and how that feature works</h2>
        <p>
          For example, May is planning a surprise party for Yang. She sends Cynthia the party details in Messenger using
          vanish mode so that the message will disappear. The message will no longer be visible to May once she leaves
          the chat, and Cynthia will see the message only the first time she opens the chat thread.
        </p>
        <p>
          After Cynthia reads the message, the content is deleted after one hour. If Cynthia never reads it, it’s
          deleted after 14 days.

          deleted, it may take us up to another 90 days to remove it from backups and disaster recovery.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you leave your deleted content in your trash on Facebook or your Recently Deleted folder on Instagram, the
          deletion process will begin automatically in 30 days. Or you can start the deletion process right away by

        <h2>Examples of why we might preserve your information</h2>
        <h3>To respond to a legal request</h3>
        <p>
          For example, we might preserve your information after you delete your account when we receive a valid legal
          request, such as a preservation order or search warrant, related to your account.
        </p>
        <h3>To comply with applicable law</h3>
        <p>
          For example, we preserve certain information about purchases or transactions associated with an account, in
          line with Meta’s accounting obligations.
        </p>
        <h3>For safety, security and integrity purposes</h3>
        <p>
          For example, if we disable an account for violating our terms or policies, we preserve information about that
          user to prevent them from opening a new account.
        </p>
        <p>
          We also might preserve some of your account information as part of our review of suspicious activity. This
          includes any suspicious activity associated with our financial products, like suspected money laundering or
          terrorist funding.
        </p>
        <h3>For litigation</h3>
        <p>
          We may preserve your information where we deem it necessary for reasons related to a legal claim or complaint.
          For example, we may be required to defend ourselves in legal proceedings in a claim related to your
          information.

        <p>
          We share the <a href="#1-WhatInformationDoWe">information we collect</a> globally, both internally across our

        <ul>
          <li>

          request, such as a preservation order or search warrant, related to your account.
        </p>
        <h3>To comply with applicable law</h3>
        <p>
          For example, we preserve certain information about purchases or transactions associated with an account, in
          line with Meta’s accounting obligations.
        </p>
        <h3>For safety, security and integrity purposes</h3>
        <p>
          For example, if we disable an account for violating our terms or policies, we preserve information about that
          user to prevent them from opening a new account.
        </p>
        <p>
          We also might preserve some of your account information as part of our review of suspicious activity. This
          includes any suspicious activity associated with our financial products, like suspected money laundering or
          terrorist funding.
        </p>
        <h3>For litigation</h3>
        <p>
          We may preserve your information where we deem it necessary for reasons related to a legal claim or complaint.
          For example, we may be required to defend ourselves in legal proceedings in a claim related to your
          information.

        <h2>What Products does this Policy cover?</h2>
        <p>
          This Policy describes the information we, Meta Platforms, Inc., process to provide
          <a href="https://www.facebook.com/legal/meta-products" target="_blank">Meta Products</a>, which we also call
          "Products."

        <h2>Metadata</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Information about the content itself, like the location where a photo was taken or the date a file was
            created
          </li>
          <li>Information about the message itself, like the type of message or the date and time it was sent</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How our ads system works</h2>
        <p>Our ads system works in the following way:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>We use your information to determine the ad interests most relevant to you.</strong> We try to
            predict your ad interests based on the information we have, including any choices you've made in Ad
            preferences.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong
              >Advertisers tell us which audience they want to reach based on who they think will be most
              interested.</strong
            >
            This can include things like age, gender, location where advertisers want to show their ad or interests,
            such as women, based in Dublin, who like golf.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>We review the potential ads that we could show you to identify the most relevant ones.</strong> Our
            ads system automatically reviews all the potential ads where you might fit the audience that advertisers
            want to reach. For example, you may see potential ads because you match the age range and interest category.
            We determine which ones to show you based on things like whether it best achieves the advertiser’s goal and
            is most relevant to you. To do this, we use algorithms and machine learning to order the ads we may show
            you. We use different factors such as the ad quality, the advertiser's desired audience and budget. We also
            consider how likely we think it is that you will react to the ad based on things like your activity on Meta
            Products. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/447278887528796" target="_blank">Learn more</a>.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>All of this information helps us show you the most relevant ads.</strong> When you see an ad on Meta
            Company Products (e.g. in your Facebook Feed), we use this process to choose the most relevant ad to show
            you.
          </li>
        </ul>
        89
        <h2>IP address</h2>
        <p>
          Stands for "internet protocol address." It’s a unique number assigned to a device, like a phone or computer,
          that allows it to communicate over the internet. Numbers are assigned according to standard guidelines, or
          protocols.
        </p>
        <p>
          Just like you need a mailing address to receive a letter from a friend, your device needs an IP address to
          receive information on the internet.
        </p>

        <h2>Partner</h2>
        <p>
          A person, business, organization or body using or integrating our Products to advertise, market or support
          their products and services
        </p>
        91
        <h2>Third party</h2>
        <p>A person, business, organization or body that is not part of the Meta Companies</p>
        92
        <h2>Service provider</h2>

          A person, business, organization or body that provides services to Meta or to our users on behalf of Meta. For
          example, our service providers do things like investigate suspicious activity and provide customer support.
